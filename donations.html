<h1>Support the Translation Project</h1>

<p><em>Dharma Pearls</em> is a long-term project that aims to transfer a large corpus of Buddhist literature preserved in middle Chinese to modern English. The core mission is to make these materials as accessible to the modern English reader as possible. Because books on this topic often fall out of print, we choose to retain our legal copyright and publish our translations as electronic publications. While we may publish physical books in the future, our translations will always be available in electronic form.</p>

<p>This means that we are not funded by selling copies of our work; rather, we are funded through the generosity of like-minded people in the world who share our love and respect for these ancient texts and the wisdom that they impart.</p>

<p>There are several ways to make donations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/winterdharma">Our Github Sponsors page</a></strong>: This is the most effective way to make a donation. Because Dharma Pearls is not an institutional or corporate project, the Github Sponsors program does not deduct any fees from the donations that we receive.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/DharmaPearls">Our Patreon page</a></strong>: Patreon is another option for supporting the project. Patreon deducts 12.3% of donations through various fees.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=JSTK8MM8J5Y7W">Our PayPal Account</a></strong>: Another option is to make contributions to my PayPal account. One-time and recurring donations can be made in this way. PayPal deducts 2.89% + a fixed fee + 1.50% for international donations. For US donors, the fees are 2.89% + $0.49.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://dharmapearls.substack.com">Subscribe to our Substack Newsletter</a></strong>: We recommend anyone who wants to receive regular updates to subscribe to our Substack newsletter. Charles Patton also posts occasional essays to Substack. It’s possible to sign up for a paid subscription as a way to donate to the project, but a free subscription will receive all our publications. Substack subscriptions have about 20% deducted in fees.</li>
  <li><strong>Donate by Mail</strong>: Lastly, donations can be sent to a physical mailing address:<br/><br/>
