<h1 id="title">The Four Noble Truths</h1>
<h2>A Non-Sectarian Survey of Buddhist Sources</h2>

<hr/>

<h3 id="sect1">1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The four noble truths are, putting simply, the thesis statement of early Buddhism. The extant sources of every school of early Buddhism considered the four noble truths to be the first teaching that the Buddha gave to his first five converts after attaining his awakening. Later Abhidharma Buddhism, which represents the full development of early Buddhist doctrine and beginnings of Buddhist philosophy, also placed at the center of Buddhist thought. While Buddhism adopted practices and concepts that were shared with other Indian religious traditions, the four noble truths appear to be an innovative teaching unique to the Buddhists.</p>

<p>In this essay, I will attempt to present a non-sectarian picture of what the four noble truths meant to early Buddhists. It will serve as a general overview that leads to a series of more focused essays that examine each of the noble truths and central concepts and practiced that they involve.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, early Buddhism has been understood until recent years through the lens of a single school of Buddhism. That bias continues despite the availability of numerous early Buddhist sources from the other schools of Buddhism. This situation hasn't been rectiied for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>One is that the Theravada school still exists today as the inheritor of the teachings of the early Buddhist tradition. When European scholars discovered the Theravada Tipitaka in the 19th c., they commenced a systematic study and translation of it. Thus, it was the first early Buddhist tradition to become available in European languages, and those initial translations have been matured through an iterative process over nearly two centuries. While academia has conducted basic studies of the other extant sources for early Buddhism, which are preserved mainly in classical Chinese, little progress was made in terms of translated them to European languages until the 2010's. These translations are still in their early stages will probably not reach the same level maturity for many years to come.</p>

<p>A second reason early Buddhist studies continues to be biased toward a Theravada interpretation is that the majority of the translators, scholars, and practitioners continue to not be very interested in studying other schools of early Buddhism. When they do bring other early sources into their studies, it's primarily to provide a text critical background to their study of Theravada sources. The initial assumption that Theravada Buddhism represents early Buddhism continues to dominate the Buddhist studies landscape. Indeed, the words "early Buddhist texts" are in practice understood to mean the earliest strata of Theravada sources. As a result, "Critical Theravada Studies" might be a more accurate description of presentday "Early Buddhist Studies."</p>

<p>A third problem that leads to the privileging of Theravada sources is that few scholars and translators in the field are fluent in Early Middle Chinese. This skill deficit means that few people are capable of any deep study of other early Buddhist sources preserved in that language. Instead, scholars and translators of early Buddhist texts are forced to rely on secondary studies, which are themselves not always well done. Translation projects to date have also suffered from a lack of fluent translators and qualified editors and reviewers. The result has been sometimes embarrassing results like the BDK translation of the Dirgha Agama, which was plagued the interpolations and misunderstandings by the English translator.</p>

<p>This essay and those that are planned to follow are intended to remedy this situation by demonstrating a methodology that brings together all the extant Early Buddhist sources in Pali, Sanskrit, and Chinese. It unfortunately will not be fully comprehensive, however, because I am myself not able to access the extant Gandhari and Tibetan sources except when competent translations or studies are available to me.</p>
