<h1>The Root of All Things</h1>
<h2>A Study of Four Parallels</h2>

<p>This <em>sūtra</em> exists today in (at least) four versions found in Pali and Middle Chinese: <a href="../../01_agama/ekottarika/44/EA_44_6.html" target="_blank">EĀ 44.6</a>, <a href="suttacentral.net/mn1" target="_blank">MN 1</a>, <a href="../../01_agama/other/T56.html" target="_blank">T56</a>, and <a href="../../01_agama/madhyama/MA_106.html" target="_blank">MĀ 106</a>. While all four versions are apparently derived from a common teaching, it’s easiest to think of them as two recensions, each with two witnesses: MN 1 and EĀ 44.6 are one closely related pair, and T56 and MĀ 106 are another. It may be that the real difference is that T56 and MĀ 106 represent the Sarvāstivāda tradition, which exists today in a shorter and longer version, and MN 1 and EĀ 44.6 represent another tradition, which also exists today in a shorter and longer version.</p>

<p>Because of this situation, I will divide this study into two parts. Part I will compare MN 1 and EA 44.5, and Part II will compare MA 106 and T56. Part III will attempt to suss out what we can of a potential ancestor text reconstructed from the commonalities found in both sets of parallels.</p>

<h3>Part I: The Root of All Things</h3>

<p>In this first comparison, I will present EĀ 44.6 and MN 1, which are both titled “The Root of All Things” (C. 一切諸法之本, P. <em>sabbadhammamūla</em>). These two texts are remarkably similar to each other even though they come from apparently very different traditions. This is not the only parallel in EĀ that bears a closer resemblance to a Theravāda <em>sutta</em> than is found in other sources. The general pattern in these cases is that the EĀ parallel displays less expansion or excess verbosity, which is the case here. Let’s begin by considering the similarities between MN 1 and EĀ 44.6.</p>

<h4>The Common Features</h4>

<p>The close relationship between these two <em>sūtra</em>s is made clear in several ways:</p>

<h5>1. Similar Titles</h5>

<p>The Pali title <em>mūlapariyāya</em> is typically interpreted to mean “the root cause” or the “the root teaching method.” The Buddha also refers to the discourse as <em>sabbadhammamūlapariyāya</em>, or “teaching method of the root of all things.” EĀ 44.6 is named 一切諸法之本 by the Buddha in both the introduction and conclusion of the text, and a shortened form is found in Chapter 44’s uddana verse1 (法之本 @ T125.2.769b6). This title could easily be read as “the root of all things” or “the root of all teaching methods.”</p>

<p>The expression “root of <em>dharma</em>s” occurs in other Buddhist sources, both early and late. Sometimes, it refers to the source of the teachings in particular, in which case it is often an epithet of the Buddha or a reference to awakening. When it refers to the source of things in general, it becomes a philosophical question.</p>

<p>This is also not the only early Buddhist text with this title. In the <cite>Madhyama Āgama</cite>, we find MĀ 113 titled “The Root of Things” (諸法本), which was a parallel of <a href="suttacentral.net/an8.83">AN 8.83</a> and <a href="suttacentral.net/an10.58">10.58</a>, which are variants of a sutta titled “The Rooted” (<em>mūlaka</em>). In these <em>sūtra</em>s, the root of all things is clearly identified as desire (P. <em>chanda</em>). I will return to this topic later when we assess the overall conclusions of this parallel study.</p>

<h5>2. Internal Structure</h5>

<p>These two <em>sūtra</em>s bear a strong resemblance in their overall structure, more so than they do with T56 and MĀ 106. This table summarizes the parallel structure of these two texts along side that of the other parallels:</p>

<h5>3. The List of Concepts</h5>

<p>They show a great deal of similarity with each other in the general make-up of the list of concepts used to illustrate the various ways people do or don’t indulge in conceptualization. The commonality can be seen when these lists are placed alongside each other and MĀ 106:

EĀ 44.6 	MN 1 	MĀ 106
Earth, water, fire air 	Earth, water, fire, air 	Earth, water, fire, air
People and gods 	Creatures and gods 	Spirits and gods
Brahmas, Mahābrahmā, Ābhāsvara, Śubhakṛtsna, Bṛhatphala, Avṛhātapa 	Pajāpati, Brahma, Ābhassara, Subhakiṇha, Vehapphala, Abhibhu 	Prajāpati, Brahmā, Avṛha, Atapa, Purity (Subha?)
The four formless heavens 	The four formless heavens 	The four formless heavens
		oneness, distinction, and diversity
What’s seen, heard, wanted, and knowledge 	What’s seen (diṭṭha), heard (suta), thought (muta), known (viññāta) 	what’s seen, heard, discerned, known, found, investigated, mental thought, mental intention, from this world to that world, from that world to this world
Oneness and diversity 	Oneness and diversity 	
The totality and Nirvāṇa 	Everything and Nibbāna 	Everything

<p>This list varies the most in the form heavens included and the types of experience, and these are the two sections where we see the more agreement between EĀ 44.6 and MN 1 than with T56 and MĀ 106.

<p>A curiosity of these parallel lists is the last item in the list of form heavens. It’s possible that abhibhu in MN 1 was a phonetic corruption of an older Prakrit word like aviyādava that’s transliterated in EĀ 44.6. This word resolves to Gandhari avi’ā-adavā, or avṛha and atapa in Sanskrit. If that’s the case, then it may well be that all the parallels included these two heavens at one time, but the tradition that EĀ 44.6 and MN 1 represent inserted Ābhāsvara, Śubhakṛtsna, and Bṛhatphala as well.

<p>For MĀ 106, we have a separate mystery in what “Purity” translated. Presumably it was a heaven, yet the Subha heavens are below Avṛha and Atapa, so perhaps it refers to the Śuddhāvāsa heavens instead with only the word Śuddha. T56 ends the form heavens in the same way, which leaves us with the same problem.

Differences Between EĀ 44.6 and MN 1

<p>These two sūtras have a number of striking differences, too:

Expansion of Introduction and Conclusion

<p>EĀ 44.6 has expanded both the introduction and conclusion compared to MN 1. EĀ’s introduction takes a moment to praise and name the teaching, and it’s conclusion wraps up the discourse with the Buddha bestowing a formal title and enjoining the monks to practice earnestly. In both texts, the Buddha addresses the monks and they respond.

Expansion of Iterations of the Main Formula

<p>MN 1 has doubled the number of recitations of the list of concepts by repeating it three times for the arhat and once for the Tathāgata. This expansion seems fairly superficial, but ostensibly the added recitations are opportunities to describe the awakening of both in piecemeal fashion. EĀ 44.6 would appear to preserve the original discourse in this regard. What is interesting, however, is that the EĀ version does include the passages that MN 1 uses to create the additional iterations of the formula.2

EĀ 44.6 Doesn’t Mention “Self” and “What Belongs to Self”

<p>The actual discussion of each concept is much simpler and makes no mention of a self or what belongs to a self the way MN 1, MĀ 106, and T56 do. This difference is interesting when we consider the larger sweep of Buddhist philosophical history, which saw the formulation and expansion of the concept of emptiness. The earliest form of that concept was that sentient beings were “empty” of a permanent self, nor did they “belong” to such a self. This was a repudiation of eternal soul theories that were popular throughout human history. That concept was eventually expanded to assert the emptiness of all things, arriving at a kind of non-essentialist nominalism. Whether or not this was the original teaching of the Buddha is unclear, but it certainly gained wide acceptance among Buddhists.

<p>In this context, we could see EĀ 44.6 as an earlier “pre-emptiness” version of this sūtra. Instead of emptiness of self, EĀ 44.6 speaks of being attached, affected, and delighting in each item in the list. This is a theme that we see in many other Buddhist texts, such as in the Aggregates Saṃyutka of SĀ and SN. Whether or not this definition of liberation predates the right knowledge/emptiness teachings is of course difficult to really know. We can see a developmental history of the latter that appears to have gradually replaced the teaching of liberation as freedom from attachment and desire until we arrive at the fully mature Mahāyāna teaching, but when exactly either idea began is difficult to ascertain.

<p>Below is a comparison of the treatments of earth for each category of practitioner in each version of the text:

EĀ 44.6 	MN 1 	T56 	MĀ 106
The Ordinary Person 			
彼觀此地如實知之：『此是地如審是地；如實是地。』⋯於中而自娛樂。所以然者，非智者之所說也。 	pathaviṁ pathavito sañjānāti; pathaviṁ pathavito saññatvā pathaviṁ maññati, pathaviyā maññati, pathavito maññati, pathaviṁ meti maññati, pathaviṁ abhinandati. Taṁ kissa hetu? ‘Apariññātaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi. 	諸有沙門婆羅門，於地有地想。樂於地、計於地為我，彼言地是我。我說彼未知。 	若有沙門、梵志於地有地想：『地即是神，地是神所，神是地所。』彼計地即是神已，便不知地。
They observe this earth and really know it: “This is earth. Truly, this is earth. Really, this is earth” … They delight themselves in this. The reason for that is the teachings of unwise people. 	They perceive earth as earth. Having perceived earth as earth, they conceive it to be earth, they conceive it in earth, they conceive it as earth, they conceive that ‘earth is mine’, they take pleasure in earth. Why is that? Because they haven’t completely understood it, I say. 	There are ascetics and priests who conceive about earth that there is earth. They delight in earth and suppose that earth is a self. They say, “Earth is self.” I say they have yet to know it. 	Suppose there are ascetics or priests who conceive about earth that there is earth: “Earth is the soul,” “earth belongs to the soul,” or “the soul belongs to earth.” Having conceived that earth is the soul, they don’t know earth.
The Trainee Disciple 			
觀此地種，皆悉分明，知所來處。亦不著於地，無有污染之心。 	sopi pathaviṁ pathavito abhijānāti; pathaviṁ pathavito abhiññāya pathaviṁ mā maññi, pathaviyā mā maññi, pathavito mā maññi, pathaviṁ meti mā maññi, pathaviṁ mābhinandi. Taṁ kissa hetu? ‘Pariññeyyaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi. 	諸有沙門婆羅門，計地為神通，不樂於地，不樂於地不計地為我，彼不言地是我。 	若有沙門、梵志於地則知地： 『地非是神，地非神所，神非地所。』 彼不計地即是神已，彼便知地。
They observe this element of earth, and they fully discern and understand it, know where it comes from. They aren’t attached to earth, and they don’t have any affected thoughts [about it]. 	… directly knows earth as earth. Having directly known earth as earth, let them not conceive it to be earth, let them not conceive it in earth, let them not conceive it as earth, let them not conceive that ‘earth is mine’, let them not take pleasure in earth. Why is that? So that they may completely understand it, I say. 	There are ascetics and priests whose supposing about earth is a spiritual penetration, and they don’t enjoy earth. Not enjoying earth, they don’t suppose that earth is self, and they don’t say, “Earth is self.” 	Suppose an ascetic or priest knows about earth that it’s earth: “Earth isn’t a soul, earth doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to earth.” Not supposing that earth is a soul, they know earth.
The Arhat Disciple 			
彼能分別地種，都不起想著。 	sopi pathaviṁ pathavito abhijānāti; pathaviṁ pathavito abhiññāya pathaviṁ na maññati, pathaviyā na maññati, pathavito na maññati, pathaviṁ meti na maññati, pathaviṁ nābhinandati. Taṁ kissa hetu? ‘Pariññātaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi. 		
They are able to discern the element of earth and not produce any attachments or concepts [about it] at all. 	… directly knows earth as earth. Having directly known earth as earth, they do not conceive it to be earth, they do not conceive it in earth, they do not conceive it as earth, they do not conceive that ‘earth is mine’, they do not take pleasure in earth. Why is that? Because they have completely understood it, I say. 		
The Tathāgata 			
比丘，當知，如來、至真、等正覺善能分別於地。亦不著於地種，不起地種之想 	Tathāgatopi, bhikkhave, arahaṁ sammāsambuddho pathaviṁ pathavito abhijānāti; pathaviṁ pathavito abhiññāya pathaviṁ na maññati, pathaviyā na maññati, pathavito na maññati, pathaviṁ meti na maññati, pathaviṁ nābhinandati. Taṁ kissa hetu? ‘Pariññātantaṁ tathāgatassā’ti vadāmi. 	復次，我以地為神通，不樂地。不樂地，不以地為我，我不計地。 	我於地則知地：『地非是神，地非神所，神非地所。』我不計地即是神已，我便知地。
Monks, you should know, the Tathāgata, the Arhat and the Completely Awakened One, is able to skillfully discern earth. He is not attached to the element of earth and doesn’t produce concepts about the element of earth. 	… directly knows earth as earth. Having directly known earth as earth, he does not conceive it to be earth, he does not conceive it in earth, he does not conceive it as earth, he does not conceive that ‘earth is mine’, he does not take pleasure in earth. Why is that? Because the Realized One has completely understood it to the end, I say. 	Furthermore, my [supposing] about earth is a spiritual penetration, and it doesn’t delight me. Not being delighted, I don’t take earth to be self, and I don’t suppose that earth [is self, and I don’t say, “Earth is self.”] 	I know about earth that it’s earth: “Earth isn’t a soul, earth doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to earth.” Not supposing that earth is a soul, I know earth.

Whatever historical process it was that led to these four versions, this arrangement from EĀ 44.6 to MĀ 106 seems to depict a developmental spectrum. It begins with a version (EĀ 44.6) that makes no mention of the concept of self but rather discusses attachment to and delight in concepts. It ends with a version (MĀ 106) that instead denies that the real view of earth involves seeing it as a self or belonging to a self without any mention of attachment or affect. The two versions in between (MN 1 and T56) combine elements of these two versions by mentioning both the conceptualizations about a self and delighting in said concepts. Given that MN 1 often follows the text of EĀ 44.6 quite closely, one is left to wonder if the inclusion of the emptiness of self isn’t a later redaction similar to the doubling of text’s length.

With that last observation, I will wrap up this essay with a correspondence table that places the parallel passages in EĀ 44.6 and MN 1 alongside each other.

Notes

    Discerning readers may notice that this is the fifth title listed in the uddana, not the sixth. This is an artifact of the corruption that took place at some point after the initial translation of EĀ that resulted in sūtras being inserted and sometimes disordered. The uddana for Chapter 44 most likely bears witness to its original contents. It lists ten sūtras rather than eleven. The content of EĀ 44.5 and EĀ 44.7 both match the titles that come before and after 法之本 (繫縛 and 病, respectively), which indicates that the order of these sūtras has been preserved. Further comparison of the uddana titles with the sūtras in Chapter 44 indicates that EĀ 44.3 was the later insertion.
    Specifically, at the end of the case of the arhat in EĀ, the section concludes with “The reason for that is that it’s brought about by the destruction of lust, hatred, and delusion” (所以然者，皆由壞婬、怒、癡之所致也). At the end of the four iterations of the arhat’s case in MN 1, we read (1) “I say, they’ve completely understood it” (‘pariññātaṁ tassā’ti vadāmi), (2) “free of greed because of the destruction of greed” (khayā rāgassa, vītarāgattā), (3) “free of hate due to the destruction of hate” (khayā dosassa, vītadosattā), and (4) “free of delusion due to the destruction of delusion” (khayā mohassa, vītamohattā).

    For the case of the Tathāgata, EĀ concludes with: “The reason for that is that it’s brought about by breaking the snare of delight. There is birth because of existence, and there is old age and death because of birth. Having brought all that to an end, he therefore is Tathāgata, and supreme and perfectly awakened one.” (所以然者，皆由破愛網之所致，因有有生，因生有老死。皆悉除盡，是故如來成最正覺). In MN 1, the two versions of the Tathāgata case conclude with (1) “because the Realized One has completely understood it to the end, I say.” (‘pariññātantaṁ tathāgatassā’ti vadāmi), and (2) “because he has understood that taking pleasure is the root of suffering, and that rebirth comes from continued existence; whoever has come to be gets old and dies” (iti viditvā ‘bhavā jāti bhūtassa jarāmaraṇan’ti).
