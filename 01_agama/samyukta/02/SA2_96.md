Suppose a monk becomes an <em>arhat</em>, has stopped being contaminated, rid himself of the heavy burden, won his own reward, ended the bonds of existence, and is correctly liberated in mind. I don’t teach the careful practice for that type of monk. Why is that? Because those monks have already been careful, they aren’t capable of doing negligent things any more. Now that I see that those venerables have gained the fruit of being careful, I don’t teach careful practice for them.</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. “For what type of monk do I teach careful practice? Suppose there are monks in the stage of learning who’ve yet to attain a higher peace of mind or orient themselves toward living in <em>nirvāṇa</em>. I teach the careful practice for this type of monk. Why is that? It’s because that monk is training his faculties, his mind is happy with the neccesities of life that he has, and he has made good friends. It won’t be long before he can stop being contaminated. Without contamination, he’ll be liberated in mind and liberated in wisdom. He’ll realize for himself in the present: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished.’ He himself will know he won’t be subject to another existence.</td>

    <td id='p5'>5. “Why is that? That monk won’t be gladdened by, praise, be affected by, or live bound to the delightful and affecting forms that his visual awareness has seen. Because he isn’t gladdened by, doesn’t praise, isn’t affected by, and doesn’t live bound [to those forms], he’s focused and makes progress. His body and mind will be calm, and his mind will be at peace and remain unforgetful. Always settled with a unified mind, his joy in the Dharma will be measureless. Just by gaining the first attainment of <em>samādhi</em>, he’ll never retreat from cessation or follow his eyes and form. It would be likewise with his auditory, olfactory, gustatory, somatic, and mental awareness and notions.”</td>

<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 212 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 274 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0053c07" target="_blank">T99.2.53c7-29</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0259a12" target="_blank">Y30.259a12-60a8</a>). Its closest parallel is <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.134" target="_blank">SN 35.134</a>. These two parallels are very similar aside from a couple small details. One is that the location here is the default one at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. Another is that here the Buddha refers to “careful practice” in general, while he mentions it specifically in the context of the six sense fields in SN 34.134. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
