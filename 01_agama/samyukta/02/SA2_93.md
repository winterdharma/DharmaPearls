    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān told the monks, “There are six sense fields of contact. What are the six? The sense field of visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and the sense field of mental contact. Suppose an ascetic or brahmin doesn’t truly know the formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape from these six sense fields of contact. You should know that this ascetic or brahmin is as far away from my Dharma and Vinaya as the sky is from the Earth.”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 209 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 271 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0052c17" target="_blank">T99.2.52c17-3a10</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0254a06" target="_blank">Y30.254a6-5a3</a>). Its closest parallel is <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.71" target="_blank">SN 35.71</a>, but it’s also similar to the variants <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.72" target="_blank">SN 35.72</a>-<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.73" target="_blank">73</a>.</p>
<p>The main difference is that here the monk who comes forward claims to understand the formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape from the six types of sensory contact. In SN 35.71-3, he says that he doesn’t understand them. Beyond that, this version is a bit more verbose than the Pali <em>sutta</em>s. We could consider this <em>sūtra</em> as a fourth variant of the same discourse. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
