<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 56 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 168 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0013b24" target="_blank">T99.2.13b24-c6</a>). There does not appear to be a parallel for this <em>sūtra</em>, which offers an alternative definition of the acquired aggregates in the previous <em>sūtra</em>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>love or hate</em>. C. 貪、恚. I’ve amended 貪 to 愛 in my translation, as I think it must be an error, given that the previous three passages read 愛、恚. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
