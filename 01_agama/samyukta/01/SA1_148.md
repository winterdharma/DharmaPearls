    <td id='p4'>4. The Buddha told the monks, “Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain it for you. Monks, those things have form, cause form, and they’re tied to form when someone examines for themselves the arising of sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble that have yet to arise and the growth [of sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble] that have already arisen. <em>Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise.</em> Monks, could it be that form is permanent, eternal, unchanging, and remains the same?”</td>

    <td id='p6'>6. The Buddha told the monks, “Good, monks! Good! Form is impermanent. Suppose good sons know that form is impermanent, painful, and changing. Parting with desire for it, it ceases, becomes tranquil, and disappears. After knowing that all forms have been impermanent, painful, and liable to change since the distant past, those good sons will stop form when it’s the cause and condition giving rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble. Having stopped it, they’ll attach to nothing. Being detached, they’ll live in well-being. Once they live in well-being, that’s called <em>nirvāṇa</em>. <em>Feelings, conceptions, volitions, and awareness are likewise.</em>”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 36 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 148 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0008a21" target="_blank">T99.2.8a21-b14</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0141a02" target="_blank">Y30.141a2-13</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.43" target="_blank">SN 22.43</a>. Note that the analysis of form differs from that of the Pali, and there’s no mention of sixteen monks.

<li id="n2"><p><em>Umbrella Mango Tree Park on the bank of the Bhadra River in Mathurā</em>. C. <span class="ch">摩偷羅國、跋提河側、傘蓋菴羅樹園</span>. SN 22.43 is placed at Sāvatthī. Aside from Mathurā, a well-known city in western India, these place names are obscure and lack good attestation in other Buddhist sources that I can find. Below is an analysis of each location name in this introduction:</p>
<p><em>Mathurā</em>. C. <span class="ch">摩偷羅國</span> (EMC. mua-t‘əu-la + “country” = Pr. <em>mathura</em> or <em>madhura</em>), P. <em>madhurā</em>, S. <em>mathurā</em>.</p>
<p><em>on the bank of the Bhadrika River</em>. C. <span class="ch">跋提河側</span> (EMC. buat-dei + “river bank”). <span class="ch">跋提</span> was sometimes used to translit. the name of one of the five original disciples, Bhadrika. It could also translit. <em>vati</em>. The river that would have been near Mathurā was the Yamunā. Perhaps this was another name for it, or a minor river in the area. I can find no attestation of this river in other sources.</p>
<p><em>Umbrella Mango Tree Park.</em> C. <span class="ch">傘蓋菴羅樹園</span> (EMC. “umbrella” + •əm-la (Pr. <em>amra</em>) + “tree” + “park”). There are a number of different grove names for Mathurā. In Theravada sources, it was called Gundāvana (alternatively spelled Kundā-, Guṇḍā-, and Kuṇḍā-). We also find the name <span class="ch">頻陀林</span> (EMC. biĕn-da + “forest”) in <span class="ch">大悲經</span> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T12n0380_p0971c17" target="_blank">T380.12.971c17</a>), which would appear to translit. <em>binda</em> or <em>vinda</em>. In the <em>Sarvāstivāda Vinaya</em> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T23n1435_p0451a06" target="_blank">T1435.23451a6</a>), the forest was called <span class="ch">阿波大羅</span> (EMC. •a-pua-da-la), which is a translit. suggestive of words like S. <em>ānapatra</em>, which could mean umbrella. It would seem to be a detail added later, given the creative variations that we see across the board. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
