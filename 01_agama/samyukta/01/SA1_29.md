    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that Venerable Rāhula visited the Buddha. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to sit at one side. He then said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, how do I know and how do I see this body of awareness and all the signs of the external world such that I’ll have no binding attachments to views of self and what belongs to self or to the tendency of self conceit?”</td>

    <td id='p3'>3. The Bhagavān then said to Rāhula, “Good! It’s good that you can ask the Tathāgata, ‘How do I know and how do I see this body of awareness and all the signs of the external world such that I’ll have no binding attachments to views of self and what belongs to self or to the tendency of self conceit?’!

    <td id='p4'>4. The Buddha told Rāhula, “Good! Listen closely! listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. Rāhula, you should observe that whatever forms there are, whether they are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, or distant or near, they are all not self, not different than self, and neither are present in the other.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> They are correctly observed with equitable wisdom in this way.</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='t99.2.5b3'>時，羅睺羅聞佛所說歡喜，奉行。</td>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 23 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 29 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0005a11" target="_blank">T99.2.5a11-b4</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0031a04" target="_blank">Y30.31a4-15</a>). It’s parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.91" target="_blank">SN 22.91</a>-<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.92" target="_blank">92</a>. It also shares a very similar template with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn18.21" target="_blank">SN 18.21</a>-<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn18.22" target="_blank">22</a> and <a href="../02/SA2_41-48.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.41-48</a> (which apply the same template to the six senses and related elements of sensory experience).</p>
<p>A comparison of this <em>sūtra</em> with SĀ 2.41-48 is instructive in the instability of Chinese translations of nearly identical Indic <em>sūtra</em>s. Seemingly minor changes in wording and grammar make the meaning of these parallel texts shift in significant ways. It’s difficult to determine whether this was the result of inconsistent translation or poor copying of the text in later centuries. The same issues may have existed in the original manuscript that was translated to Chinese, too. Being that it’s difficult to decide with certainty which version is the most accurate, I’ve translated both Chinese translations as faithfully as possible. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>they are all not self, not different than self, and neither are present in the other</em>. C. <span class="ch">彼一切非我、不異我、不相在</span>. The last of these three options lit. means “not mutually present.” It was actually a contraction of two options: self is not in form, and form is not in self (= P. <em>attani vā rūpaṁ, rūpasmiṁ vā attānaṁ</em>). This shorthand is quite common in SĀ. The full set of four options does, however, occur a few times as <span class="ch">色是我，色異我，我在色，色在我</span> (cf. SĀ 1.157, 1.169, and 1.177). [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>right at that moment</em>. C. <span class="ch">正無間等</span>. Lit. “exactly immediate.” There are passages in SĀ that appear to indicate that P. <em>abhisamaya</em> is the parallel to <span class="ch">無間等</span>, but the two words mean very different things, making it unlikely to me. S. <em>ānantarya</em> (“immediate succession”) would match the meaning of C. much better. If that’s the case, then the Indic parallel would have been equiv. to something like S. <em>samānantarya</em> (“a complete immediacy”?). The functional meaning of the word here would seem to describe the immediacy of a sudden realization. This might explain why the corresponding word in some P. parallels is <em>abhisamaya</em> (“penetration to understanding”). [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
