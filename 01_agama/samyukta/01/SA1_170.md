    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān roused from his meditation in the afternoon, prepared a seat in front of the monks, and sat down. Then, he addressed the monks, “There are five acquired aggregates. What are the five? They are the acquired aggregate of form, feeling … conception … volition … and the acquired aggregate of awareness.”</td>

    <td class='ch' title='t99.2.14b15'>時，有一比丘從坐起，整衣服偏袒右肩，右膝著地。 合掌，白佛言： 「世尊，此五受陰，色受陰，受⋯想⋯行⋯識受陰耶？」</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. There was then a monk who rose from his seat, adjusted his robe to bare his right shoulder, and knelt his right knee to the ground. With his palms together, he asked the Buddha, “Bhagavān, these five acquired aggregates are the acquired aggregate of form, feeling … conception … volition … and the acquired aggregate of awareness?”</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. That monk then bowed to the Buddha and returned to his original seat. He asked the Buddha, “Bhagavān, what is the root of these five acquired aggregates? What forms them? What gives rise to them? What instigates them?”<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></td>

That is an excellent teaching! Now, I have another question. Bhagavān, are the aggregates in fact acquisition or are the five aggregates different from acquisition?”</td>

Whatever feelings, concepts, and volitions there are, they are all conditioned by contact. Name and form are the causes and name and form are the conditions [of awareness], therefore it’s called the awareness aggregate. Why is that?

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 58 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 170 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0014b12" target="_blank">T99.2.14b12-15b3</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.82" target="_blank">SN 22.82</a>.</p>
<p>The narrative introducing this discourse is different than the introduction to SN 22.82. There, the setting was an assembly of the monks during the night of the full moon sabbath. Here, there is no special occasion other than the Buddha emerging from meditation. He then goes to the monks, and briefly states that there are five acquired aggregates. Both introductions serve to explain why a monk approached the Buddha to ask a series of ten questions. Some of these questions analyze how these acquired aggregates are different than the five aggregates, which suggests that the concept was introduced after the aggregates were well established.</p>
<p>Comparing the series of ten questions and answers here to those in SN 22.82, the answers are nearly identical, but several questions are put in different terms. For instance, there is a question in SN 22.82 about personality view (P. <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>) that is paralleled here with a question about self conceit (C. <span class="ch">我慢</span>, S. <em>asmimāna</em>). In another case, a question here about what one must know and see to end the contaminants is paralleled in SN 22.82 by a question about ending I-making, mine-making, etc. These alternate forms of the questions have little impact on their answers and should probably be considered equivalent to each other. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>what is the root … come together  … arise  … instigated?</em> C. <span class="ch">以何為根？以何集？以何生？以何觸？</span> In SN 22.82, there is only one question about the root of the acquired aggregates. This series of four questions is very similar to the series of questions asked about the pains suffered by sentient beings in SĀ 3.9. I have translated them similarly as I did there. See the <a href="../03/SA3_9.html#n3" target="_blank">notes to that <em>sūtra</em> for a discussion of these terms</a>. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p>This <em>uddāna</em> verse only lists the questions that were asked in this <em>sūtra</em>, which leaves the preceding eleven <em>sūtra</em>s (SĀ 1.159-169) without an <em>uddāna</em>. Yinshun suggests that <span class="ch">二味</span> should be amended to <span class="ch">味二</span>, given that there are two questions on the subject of self conceit. It’s also notable that the last section about <em>karma</em> is absent from the <em>uddāna</em>. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
