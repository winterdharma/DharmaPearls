<li id="n1">This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 14 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 20 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0002c11" target="_blank">T99.2.2c11-3a5</a>). It’s a variant of the previous one (<a href="SA1_19.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.19</a>). Both correspond to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.26" target="_blank">SN 22.26-28</a>, with this <em>sūtra</em> being closest to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.27" target="_blank">SN 22.27</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>realized … as a result</em>. Ch. 隨順覺. The parallel word in SN 22.27 is P. <em>tadajjhagama</em> (“found that”), which combines a relative pronoun with a form of P. <em>adhigacchati</em>. The C. appears to translate a different word in Prakrit that meant something like “consequently realized.” Of course, “realized” in the sense of discovering something is similar to the meaning of “found” that P. <em>adhigacchati</em> can have. I wonder if the Prakrit here might have been equiv. to <em>anugacchati</em>. It would explain the prefix 隨順, which often translated <em>anu-</em> in Indic words. While S. <em>gacchati</em> has meanings like the P. word (“to go, obtain, pass away”), it can also mean “to understand” or “perceive,” which matches 覺 much better than P. <em>adhigacchati</em>.
