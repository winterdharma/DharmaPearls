He then said, “It’d be good, Bhagavān, if you would briefly explain the Dharma for me now. After hearing the Dharma, I’ll go alone to a quiet place and cultivate it earnestly. After cultivating it earnestly, I’ll again contemplate: ‘A good son leaves home, cuts off his hair and beard, puts on the Dharma robes, believes at home in being homeless, and leaves home to train on the path. That’s the way he reaches the ultimate and unsurpassed religious life. He’ll realize in the present life: “My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”]<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></td>

<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 16 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 22 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0003b14" target="_blank">T99.2.3b14-27</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0024a03" target="_blank">Y30.24a3-10</a>). It corresponds to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.36" target="_blank">SN 22.36</a> and is similar to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.35" target="_blank">SN 22.35</a>. Aside from being largely abbreviated by the C. translator, the only difference between this <em>sūtra</em> and the previous one is that it substitutes “increasing in number” for “bound by grasping.” See the notes to <a href="SA1_21.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.21</a> for more discussion of these parallels. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>A large portion of this <em>sūtra</em> was omitted as identical to SĀ 1.21. The passages in brackets have been reconstituted following the Chinese translator’s abbreviation notes. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
