He said to the Buddha, “Gautama, I have a young disciple who knows astronomy and the clans. He divines fortune and misfortune for the great community. When he says there is something, then there surely is. When he says there is nothing, then there surely isn’t. When he says something will be created, it surely is.

    <td id='p9'>9. The brahmin said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, it’s this teaching and Dharma, as the Buddha has taught it, made it plain, and revealed it.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 54 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 166 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0013a17" target="_blank">T99.2.13a17-b12</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0167a11" target="_blank">Y30.167a11-8a9</a>). This <em>sūtra</em> does not appear to have a direct parallel in the Pali <em>sutta</em>s. It belongs to a genre of <em>sūtra</em>s which feature encounters with brahmins and their teachings. They typically criticize brahmins and Brahminism in various ways and depict the Buddha as defeating them in debates or converting them with superior reasoning. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>*Vikataloka</em>. C. <span class="ch">毘迦多魯迦</span> (EMC. bii-kă-ta-lo-kă = <em>vikaṭaloka</em>?). There doesn’t seem to be any precedent or parallel for this name other than <em>vikaṭa</em> being the name of certain <em>yakṣa</em>s and the name of a mountain in BHS sources. But it seems a straightforward transliteration. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>originally have no seed</em>. C. <span class="ch">本無種</span>. It seems most likely that <span class="ch">無種</span> translated P/S. <em>abīja</em>, which would literally mean “not a seed” or “infertile.” Perhaps here this is another word for a cause. Not being certain about the exact intent here, I’ve translated the C. literally. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
