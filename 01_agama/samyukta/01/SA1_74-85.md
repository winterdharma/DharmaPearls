<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 66 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and nos. 74-85 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0017b16" target="_blank">T99.2.17b16-c9</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0108a02" target="_blank">Y30.108a2-15</a>). The basic template is similar to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.5" target="_blank">SN 22.5</a>-<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.6" target="_blank">6</a>. However, in this case, that template has been replicated with twelve different synonymous verbs for understanding the nature of the aggregates.</p>
<p>This pattern is repeated with <a href="SA1_62-73.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.62-73 (65)</a>, <a href="SA1_86-97.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.86-97 (67)</a>, and <a href="SA1_98-109.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.98-109 (68)</a>. Each of these sets of twelve <em>sūtra</em>s change the description of what’s understood and replicate the template with the same twelve synonyms for understanding. Thus, four variations are multiplied in twelve ways to arrive at a total of 48 <em>sūtra</em>s. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>twelve </em>sūtra<em>s.</em> C. <span class="ch">十二經</span>. The note at the end of this and the next two groups of <em>sūtra</em>s is an abbreviation of the same note found at the end of <a href="SA1_62-73.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.62-73</a>. It should be noted that here twelve <em>sūtra</em>s are indicated rather than two, which is likely the correct reading. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
