    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the lord of the village and the great clan of brahmins heard this: “An ascetic who was a son of the Śākya tribe and from a great clan of the Śākyas shaved off his hair and beard, put on the reddish-brown robes, had proper faith in homelessness, and left home to train on the path. Having achieved the unsurpassed and complete awakening, he is wandering now among the people here in Kosala. He has arrived here and is staying in the rosewood grove north of Sālā.</td>

He is the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Completely Awakened One, the One Complete in Insight and Conduct, the Well Gone One, the Understander of the World, the Unsurpassed Man, the Trainer of Men, and the Teacher of Gods and Humans who is the Buddha and Bhagavān. He is the great sage in the world with its gods like Māra and Brahmā and ascetics and brahmins. He knows by his own realization: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished.’ He himself knows that he won’t be subject to a later existence. He teaches for the world a Dharma that is good in the beginning, middle, and end, and it’s good in its content and good in its expression. Being consistent, complete, and pure, it explains the wondrous Dharma of the clean religious practice.”</td>

It would be excellent to pay our respects to him!” After having this thought, they then prepared their horses and led many of their followers while carrying golden vases, golden batons, and parasols.

    <td id='p10'>10. The Buddha told the brahmins, “The foolish and unlearned ordinary man doesn’t truly know the formation of form, cessation of form, enjoyment of form, trouble of form, or escape from form. Not truly knowing them, he takes delight in form, praises form, is affected by it, and his mind abides there. He grasps it because he takes delight in form. Grasping is a condition for existence, existence is a condition for birth, birth is a condition for old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain. This then forms a great mass of suffering. <em>Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise.</em> Brahmins, these are called the causes and conditions that form the world and the causes and conditions that are the formation of the world.”</td>

When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, existence ceases. When existence ceases, birth ceases. When birth ceases, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, trouble, and pain cease. <em>Feeling, conception, volition, and awareness are likewise.</em> Brahmins, these are called the causes and conditions that cease the world and the causes and conditions that are the cessation of the world.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 53 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 165 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0012c04" target="_blank">T99.2.12c4-3a16</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0165a06" target="_blank">Y30.165a6-6a11</a>). This <em>sūtra</em> does not appear to have a direct parallel in the Pali <em>sutta</em>s, but it consists of common elements brought together in a particular way. First, it belongs to a genre of <em>sūtra</em>s in which the inhabitants of a brahmin village go to question the Buddha after hearing about his fame and virtue. Second, it presents a shortened form of dependent origination and cessation that proceed from grasping or craving to suffering. Third, it identifies the acceptance and delight in the aggregates as leading to rebirth. Thus, there is no unique innovation here other than using the five aggregates as a substitute for the first half of the full chain of dependent origination. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>Kosala</em>. C. <span class="ch">拘薩羅國</span> (EMC kɪu-sat-la + “country” = Pr. <em>kosala</em>), G. <em>kosala</em>, P. <em>kosala</em>, S. <em>kausala</em> or <em>kauśala</em>. This was the country bordering Magadha and Kāśī and ruled by King Pasenadi (S. Prasenajit). The capital city was Śrāvastī, where the Buddha spent the majority of his time as a teacher.</p>
<p><em>village of Sālā</em>. C. <span class="ch">薩羅聚落</span> (EMC sat-la + “village” = Pr. <em>salagama</em>), G. <em>salagrama</em>, P. <em>sālā brāhmaṇagāma</em>. The transliteration of this village’s name was confused in this <em>sūtra</em> and in the summary verse after SĀ 1.168 (56). That is, <span class="ch">薩</span> (EMC sat) was confused with <span class="ch">婆</span> (EMC bua). <span class="ch">婆</span> was often a typo for <span class="ch">娑</span> (EMC sa). Perhaps the original text read <span class="ch">娑羅</span>, which was a common way of writing Indic <em>sala</em>. This may have been corrupted to <span class="ch">婆羅</span> and later corrected to <span class="ch">薩羅</span> (which was used for this village name in other texts), but not all the occurrences were found and fixed.</p>
<p><em>rosewood grove</em>. C. <span class="ch">申恕林</span> (EMC ʃɪĕn-ʃɪo + “forest” = Pr. <em>śiṃśa[pa]vana</em>), G. ?, P. <em>sīsapāvana</em>, S. <em>śiṃśapāvana</em>. This was the name of the Indian rosewood tree, often called the <em>śiśu</em> tree today. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
