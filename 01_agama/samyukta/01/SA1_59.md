They are the acquired aggregate of form, feeling … conception … volition … and the acquired aggregate of awareness. A foolish and unlearned man without wisdom or insight becomes tied to views of self about these five acquired aggregates that arise. Greed is produced when his mind is tied to them. Monks, a well-versed noble disciple with wisdom and insight doesn’t become tied to views of self about these five acquired aggregates or is greed produced when his mind is tied to them.</td>
