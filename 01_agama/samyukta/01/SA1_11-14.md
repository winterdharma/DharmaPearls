Noble disciples who observe them in this way don’t look back to past form or wish for future form.

<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 8 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and nos. 11 to 14 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0001c22" target="_blank">T99.2.1c22-2a1</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y30n0030_p0010a13" target="_blank">Y30.10a13-11a4</a>). This group of <em>sūtra</em>s is parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.9" target="_blank">SN 22.9</a>-<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.11" target="_blank">11</a>. The Pali lacks a direct parallel for the <em>sūtra</em> on the emptiness of the aggregates (<a href="SA1_13.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.13</a>), which is a general pattern in SN. The Theravādins didn’t usu. include emptiness in the standard list of negative aspects attributed to conditioned things that arise and perish. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>headed straight to</em>. C. <span class="ch">正向</span>. Here, <span class="ch">正</span> is likely read as “exact” rather than “correct,” and <span class="ch">向</span> means a heading or facing. Together, they mean “headed directly toward.” The Pali parallel here appears to be the past particle P. <em>paṭipanna</em> (= G. <em>paḍipaṃna</em>, S. <em>pratipanna</em>), but there it applies to all three steps rather than just the last one (i.e., cessation). Both P. <em>paṭipanna</em>  and S. <em>pratipanna</em> can mean “entered,” “arrived,” or “approached,” which generally matches the C. reading. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
