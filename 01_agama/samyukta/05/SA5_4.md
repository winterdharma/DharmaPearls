    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Sentient beings always associate with their elements, and those with those elements come together. How do sentient beings always associate with the elements? When sentient beings act on thoughts that aren’t good, they associate with elements that aren’t good. When their thoughts are good, they associate with good elements. When their thoughts are lowly, they associate with lowly elements. When their thoughts are greater, they associate with greater elements.”</td>

<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 447 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 695 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0115a24" target="_blank">T99.2.115a24-b23</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y31n0030_p0161a03" target="_blank">Y30.161a3-2a1</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn14.15" target="_blank">SN 14.15</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ea49.3" target="_blank">EĀ 49.3</a>, and the second half of <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T17n0765_p0689a06" target="_blank">T765 No. 110</a>.

<li id="n2"><p>What follows is an extended narration pointing out that various disciples and their followers were walking near where the Buddha was speaking. This acts as a kind of intermission before the Buddha’s conclusion is given. The episode was no doubt intended to illustrate the idea of sentient beings associating with each other based on common interests, goals, or abilities. This also serves as a narrative gloss as to the meaning of <em>dhātu</em> as referring to the things that beings have in common.</p>
<p>In SN 14.15, the very similar list of disciples and their followers is used to the same effect, but there the Buddha points each of them out to the monks as part of his lecture. We should also note that there are only eight great disciples mentioned in SN 14.15, whereas here there are thirteen.</p>
<p>The other direct parallel EĀ 49.3 has a very similar format as SN 14.15, but it lists twelve great disciples as examples.</p>
<p>In the <cite>Itivṛttaka</cite> parallel translated by Xuanzang, the list of disciples is given by the Buddha, which resembles that found here but in a different order and expanded to twenty example disciples.</p> [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>Anaruddha.</em> C. <span class="ch">阿那律陀</span> (EMC •a-na-lɪuĕt-da = Pr. <em>anaruddha</em>), G. <em>anuruddha</em> or <em>anaruddha</em>, P. <em>anuruddha</em>, S. <em>aniruddha</em>. This is yet another alternate spelling of this disciple’s name. In Pali, his name is given as <em>anuruddha</em>, and it’s usually <em>aniruddha</em> in Buddhist Sanskrit. This third spelling as <em>anaruddha</em> is attested in Gandhari sources. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>Śroṇakoṭīviṃśa.</em> C. <span class="ch">二十億耳</span>. His name has been translated to C. literally as “twenty million ears.” I’ve adopted the Sanskrit attestation of his name. His Pali parallel seems to be Soṇa Koḷivisa, who was a more obscure disciple in the Theravāda tradition. Both were said to have hair growing on the bottoms of their feet.
