<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 446 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 694 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0115a12" target="_blank">T99.2.115a12-23</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn14.16" target="_blank">SN 14.16</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/iti78" target="_blank">Iti 78</a>, and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T17n0765_p0689a06" target="_blank">T765 No. 110</a> in terms of its verse summary, while the prose is parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn14.14" target="_blank">SN 14.14</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike SN 14.16, this <em>sūtra</em> is identical to the prose of the <a href="SA5_2.html" target="_blank">previous <em>sūtra</em></a> (which is parallel to SN 14.14). The only difference here is the addition of verses that provide a more context for the prose, which is that good and bad elements refers to laziness and diligence in a monk’s practice.</p>
<p>The verses found in SN 14.16 are replicated in Iti 78, which has prose similar to SN 14.14. There is also a parallel <em>sūtra</em> found in Xuanzang’s translation of an <cite>Itivṛttaka</cite> collection (T765, No. 110). This parallel <em>sūtra</em> adds some commentary to the basic teaching in a different way than SN 14.16, but the verses are very similar. Thus, we can see that there is a cluster of parallels in SN, SĀ, Iti, and T765 that share a common teaching and verses that were associated with it. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
