<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 291 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 472 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0082a28" target="_blank">T99.2.82a28-c17</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y31n0030_p0019a09" target="_blank">Y30.19a9-21a2</a>). This <em>sūtra</em> is parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.66" target="_blank">SN 12.66</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sf158" target="_blank">SF158</a>. It bears a stronger resemblance to the Sanskrit parallel (SF158), which may have also been from the Sarvāstivāda tradition.</p>
<p>The main difference between SN 12.66 and the other two parallels is in the analysis of the topics, but the basic outline is the same. They begin by describing an introspective practice examining the source of suffering and tracing it back through craving, attachments, and pleasant forms that cause attachment.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that this <em>sūtra</em> demonstrates a very basic analysis of suffering using the method of dependent origination without using the usual terminology. It would seem that much of the analysis has been added later given how much variation there is between the Pali and other versions. Still, none of the analysis in either case is very unusual. It seems to serve the function of explaining a non-standard form of dependent origination in (what became) more familiar terms. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>Do all of you grasp the introspection that I teach?</em> C. <span class="ch">我說內觸法，汝等為取不？</span>, P. <em>sammasatha no tumhe, bhikkhave, antaraṁ sammasanti</em>, S. <em>saṁmṛśatha yūyaṁ mayā deśitam antaḥsaṁmarśam</em>.</p>
<p>The C. translation matches the Sanskrit parallel better than the Pali, assuming that <span class="ch">取</span> translated S. <em>saṁmṛśatha</em> (P. <em>sammasatha</em>) and <span class="ch">觸法</span> translated S. <em>saṁmarśam</em> (P. <em>sammasanti</em>). It would seem that <span class="ch">法</span> may only function to indicate that <span class="ch">觸</span> is a noun.</p>
<p>The verb S. <em>saṁmṛśati</em> (<em>sammasati</em>) literally means to physically touch or handle something, perhaps with the idea of someone inspected and exploring an object with their hands. This physical meaning was extended to touching or exploring something mentally, which translates to “reflect, understand, think, consider.” It’s similar to English “to grasp,” which can mean to hold something in hand or to have a good understanding.</p>
<p>With the above meanings in mind, we can see the C. translation is an attempt to capture the lit. meaning with words like <span class="ch">取</span> (“grasp, take”) and <span class="ch">觸</span> (“contact, touch”). The upshot is that we should probably read <span class="ch">內觸法</span> as meaning something like “introspection” or “exploring oneself” (“internal” usu. means “within oneself” in Buddhist language). However, <span class="ch">內觸法</span> would normally be read as “internal contact <em>dharma</em>” or perhaps “method of internal contact.” We only know that it likely translates an expression like S. <em>antaḥsaṁmarśam</em> because of the extant Indic parallels.</p>
<p>One last note to make about this term is that Xuanzang appears to translate it in his <em>Yogācārabhūmi</em> commentary on this <em>sūtra</em> (@ <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T30n1579_p0830a26" target="_blank">T1579.30.830a26</a>) as <span class="ch">能正思量</span> (“to think, consider or conceive correctly”), where <span class="ch">正</span> = <em>saṁ-</em>, <span class="ch">思量</span> = <em>mṛśati</em>, and <span class="ch">能</span> communicates that it is an active voice and/or present tense verb. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>what is the cause, formation, arising, and instigation.</em> C. <span class="ch">何因、何集、何生、何觸</span>, P. <em>kiṁnidānaṁ kiṁsamudayaṁ kiṁjātikaṁ kiṁpabhavaṁ</em>, S. <em>kinnidānaṁ kiṁsamudayaṁ kiṁjātīyaṁ kiṁprabhavam</em>.</p>
<p>This series of four questions occurs in six different <em>sūtra</em>s in SĀ, including this and the next one. The C. translation of these four synonyms is straightforward until we reach the last one. In some passages, it’s translated as <span class="ch">轉</span>, and in others (as here) it’s translated as <span class="ch">觸</span>. Neither of these words are typically equiv. to S. <em>prabhava</em> (“origin, source, production”), but they do both have less common readings that are similar to it. <span class="ch">觸</span> can mean “to arouse, stimulate, affect,” and <span class="ch">轉</span> can mean “to come about, arise, come forth.” Yinshun suggests that we amend <span class="ch">觸</span> to <span class="ch">轉</span>, which is not unreasonable if we assume <em>prabhava</em> was the word being translated. <span class="ch">觸</span> is the more common rendering, so I have kept this reading and translated it as “instigation.”  [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>attachments.</em> C. <span class="ch">億波提</span> (EMC ɪək-pua-dei), P. <em>upadhi</em>. The C. translit. here is unusual. <span class="ch">億</span> is a numeral not used for transliterations in Chinese Buddhist texts, which makes it difficult to assess what syllable it was intended to represent. Characters like <span class="ch">鬱</span> (EMC •ɪuət), <span class="ch">憂</span> (EMC •ɪəu), <span class="ch">優</span> (EMC •ɪəu), and <span class="ch">烏</span> (EMC •o) were typically used to represent the initial Indic <em>u-</em> or <em>o-</em> sound.</p>
<p>Probably <span class="ch">億</span> is a typo for <span class="ch">優</span>, in which case it would sound out <em>upadhi</em>. This Prakrit word generally refers to things to which one is attached in Pali sources, especially to the aggregates that form the basis for existence in the world. As such, it seems to be a technical term that was not well-known in other Sanskrit sources. The fact that it was transliterated to C. suggests that the translator considered it important that it was not confused for another word (such as the more standard <em>upādāna</em>).</p>
<p>Another curiosity is that this term doesn’t appear to occur in the version of this <em>sūtra</em> known to the <em>Yogācārabhūmi</em>’s author (cf. the note above). The commentary there explains suffering as caused by craving, which in turn is caused by pleasing forms, without any mention of grasping or attachments. Instead, there is a discussion of the three time periods. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>worldly forms that are agreeable and proper.</em> C. <span class="ch">世間所念端正之色</span>, P. <em>loke piyarūpaṁ sātarūpaṁ</em>, S. <em>loke priyarūpaṁ sātarūpaṁ</em>. This expression occurs five times in this <em>sūtra</em>, the translation of which suffers from inconsistencies and/or typos. I have translated them all assuming that <span class="ch">世間、可念、端正之色</span> is the intended reading, where <span class="ch">世間、可念、端正</span> are three adjectives describing <span class="ch">色</span>, which respectively mean “worldly,” “agreeable,” and “proper.” I am assuming that <span class="ch">可念</span> is equiv. to <span class="ch">可意</span> and translates a word like P. <em>manāpa</em>, as it does elsewhere in SĀ (e.g., <a href="../SA2/SA2_94.html" target="_blank">SĀ 2.94</a>). <span class="ch">端正</span> (“neat, upright, handsome”) likely translates a word like <em>abhirūpa</em> (“learned, handsome, beautiful, pleasing”). Both the P. and S. parallels appear to describe these worldly forms with different synonyms as these, but the C. translation might also be awkwardly done. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p><em>a cool pond alongside a road, which is full of fragrance and flavor.</em> C. <span class="ch">路側清涼池水，香味具足</span>, P. <em>āpānīyakaṁso vaṇṇasampanno gandhasampanno rasasampanno</em>. This is a departure from SN 12.66, which uses a drinking cup full of something delicious (which goes unspecified). The Sanskrit parallel does not include a metaphor, though it was perhaps lost in the first half of the text that was damaged. We should note, too, that the P. parallel adds a third description of the drink as “full of color” (<em>vaṇṇasampanna</em>), suggesting something other than water. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
