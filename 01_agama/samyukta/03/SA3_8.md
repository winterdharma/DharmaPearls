    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A foolish, untaught ordinary man becomes disillusioned, free of desire, and freed from the form body of four elements, but not awareness. Why is that? It’s apparent that the form body of the four elements increases and decreases, and it’s acquired and discarded. Whether it’s his heart, mind, or awareness, that foolish, untaught ordinary man cannot become disillusioned, free of desire, or freed from that awareness. Throughout the long night, he protects, values, and ties it to himself.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> Whether it’s ascertained or grasped, he says: ‘This is my self, it belongs to me, they exist together.’ Therefore, the foolish, untaught ordinary man isn’t able to become disillusioned, free of desire, freed from that.</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 290 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 471 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0082a01" target="_blank">T99.2.82a1-27</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y31n0030_p0017a09" target="_blank">Y30.17a9-8a8</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.62" target="_blank">SN 12.62</a>.</p>
<p>This <em>sūtra</em> is interesting in that it addresses the fact that it’s much easier to identify with our mind (or spirit), while our body is more naturally viewed as something else possessed or controlled by our mind. The rationale give for this, however, gives us some insight into the cultural assumptions of early Buddhists. Instead of pointing out that the body is controlled by the mind, the Buddha says the reason is that it changes much more slowly, and the impermanence is more obvious.</p>
<p>We also must remember the assumption of rebirth informing the idea that the body is discarded by what animates it, which then continues in some spiritual form or takes another physical body. These ideas common to early human belief systems would certainly cause people to consider what survives death of the body to be an enduring self. In Buddhism, this was usually called “awareness” (S. <em>vijñāna</em>), but the idea of an eternal self was rejected.</p>
<p>We also find in this <em>sūtra</em> the idea that the mind arises and ceases from one moment to the next rather than persisting continuously, like a motion picture that consists of individual frames that flash by rapidly. This would become an important theory in Abhidharma Buddhism used to explain the continuous change of all things, including one’s mental state. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>the long night.</em> C. <span class="ch">長夜</span>, G. <em>digharatra</em>, P. <em>dīgharattaṃ</em>, S. <em>dīrgharātram</em>. Most sources reduce this figurative expression to its functional meaning of “for a long time,” but I think its usage here refers specifically to a long time being reborn in <em>saṃsāra</em>. In that context, the imagery of a long night is meaningful and signals something more than the passage of time. There is the struggle to get through it, and the implicit metaphor of darkness for ignorance. I have translated it literally here for this reason. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>divided day and night, not remaining for a moment as it develops and changes in verious ways, arising as one thing and ceasing as another.</em> C. <span class="ch">日夜時刻，須臾不停，種種轉變，異生、異滅</span>, P. <em>taṁ rattiyā ca divasassa ca aññadeva uppajjati aññaṁ nirujjhati</em>. The P. parallel here lacks the additional description beyond “arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night.”</p>
<p>The illustration of a monkey moving continuously through a forest canopy is not found in SN 35.62, either. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>dependent arising of things.</em> C. <span class="ch">諸緣起</span>, P. <em>paṭiccasamuppādaṃyeva</em>. The C. translation here makes dependent arising (<span class="ch">緣起</span>) effectively plural with the modifier <span class="ch">諸</span> (“all, many”). This might refer to the steps in a chain of dependent arising, but I’ve read it more simply as the dependent arising of various things in general. The idea being that the noble disciple analyzes any given thing with the principle of dependent arising.</p>
<p>The P. parallel passage instead reads “dependent arising only” (<em>paṭiccasamuppāda + eva</em>), but I think this intends the same idea: That the principle is applied to everything the noble disciple encounters. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p>Here, happy (<span class="ch">喜</span>) and sad (<span class="ch">憂</span>) feelings have been inserted into the analysis of three types of feeling to cover both physical and mental feelings, but otherwise the passage here and the metaphor below is equivalent to the passage in SN 35.62. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p><em>contact produces that formation of contact.</em> C. <span class="ch">觸生觸集</span>. This statement seems circular and unnecessary, and there is no parallel to it in SN 35.62. I suspect it may be a copyist or editor error. However, I have left it as-is in case it did have some doctrinal significance for Sarvāstivādins. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
