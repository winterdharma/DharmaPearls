<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 371 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 534 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0101c25" target="_blank">T99.2.101c25-2a11</a>). It’s a close parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.11" target="_blank">SN 12.11</a>. There are subtle differences in wording, however.</p>
<p>For example, the four foods are not characterized as helping sentient beings who haven’t been born yet. We should notice, too, that there is no fine physical food, but rather the food of contact is called fine. This suggests a definition of contact like the one found in EĀ 29.4, which is very similar to the definition of fine physical food in other sources (clothing, perfumes, bathing, and the like). Also, the fourth question asked about the causes of the four foods, craving, and feeling is here “contact” (觸) rather than “coming into being” (P. <em>pabhava</em>).</p>
<p>Another difference is that the chain of dependent origination here only goes back to the six sense fields, while in SN 12.11 it goes back to ignorance. Finally, the main point of this <em>sūtra</em> is that the four foods are synonymous with grasping and existence in dependent origination. This detail is absent from SN 12.11. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>What causes … what forms … what produces … what contacts … ?</em> C. 何因？何集？何生？何觸？. A very similar set of four questions is asked in <a href="../01/SA1_169.html#p13" target="_blank">SĀ 1.169</a>, but there the fourth question is “what develops” (何轉). In the P. parallels, the last question is “what brings about” (<em>kiṁpabhavā</em>). Here, “what contacts” (何觸) doesn’t fit the pattern of synonyms for a cause.</p>
<p>Yinshun chose to amend 觸 to 轉 in this passage, but I have decided to let it stand for the time being with this footnote. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>The formation of craving is the formation of food.</em> Here, food is inserted in the place of both grasping and existence in the usual chain of dependent origination. The chain then resumes with birth. This makes the four foods objects of grasping and continued existence. This certainly makes sense if we don’t assume the psychological foods (contact, thought, and awareness) are synonymous with other items in dependent origination. This is in fact the intended reading here because in Sarvāstivāda sources (e.g., the <cite>Saṅgītiparyāya</cite>), the four foods explain how other classes of sentient beings besides humans are nurtured and sustained.</p>
<p>This substitution is missing from SN 12.11, which leaves those types of food more open to interpretation. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
