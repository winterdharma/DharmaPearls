<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 292 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 473 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0082c18" target="_blank">T99.2.82c18-3b29</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y31n0030_p0022a04" target="_blank">Y30.22a4-4a7</a>). This <em>sūtra</em> is parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.51" target="_blank">SN 12.51</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sf159" target="_blank">SF159</a>. It bears a much stronger resemblance to the Sanskrit parallel (SF159), which may have also been from the Sarvāstivāda tradition.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this <em>sūtra</em> appears to be a variation of the previous one (<a href="SA3_9.html" target="_blank">SĀ 3.9</a>) when placed in the context of its parallels. (For example, SF159 repeats the usage of the word <em>upadhi</em> in the place of <em>upādāna</em>, which is not apparent when reading the C. translation here.) It includes most of the standard twelve step chain of dependent origination and uses different verbs for contemplating suffering. It may represent a later normalization of SĀ 3.9, which presents a much shorter and cryptic version of dependent origination. See the notes below and those to SĀ 3.9 for more in-depth discussions of the textual issues involved. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>Think about grasping as their cause, their formation, their arising, and their instigation.</em> C. <span class="ch">思量，取因、取集、取生、取觸</span>, S. <em>sa evaṁ parimīmāṁsamāno jānāti | idaṁ duḥkham upadhinidānam upadhisamudayam upadhijātīyam upadhiprabhavam</em>. SN 12.51 does not have a parallel for this passage. It instead follows the standard chain of dependent origination that begins with suffering and ends with ignorance. In this <em>sūtra</em>, birth and existence are skipped, and the chain proceeds from grasping until ignorance is reached.</p>
<p>The omission of birth and existence is strange, but the S. parallel sheds some light on why this is the case. There, what the C. translates as grasping (<span class="ch">取</span>) appears to actually be <em>upadhi</em>, as it was in the previous <em>sūtra</em>. It would seem that here that term was translated rather than transliterated, and the discourse proceeds from that point forward with the standard chain of dependent origination. This is in contrast to the previous <em>sūtra</em> that presented a shorter, non-standard chain of dependent origination: suffering <- attachments (<em>upadhi</em>) <- craving <- worldly forms that are agreeable and proper. I say “it would seem” because it’s possible that the original had replaced <em>upadhi</em> with <em>upādāna</em>.</p>
<p>This would explain why this <em>sūtra</em> was placed after the previous one in both the C. translation and S. parallel. It was a variation on the same theme that employed the term <em>upadhi</em>. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>In that way.</em> C. <span class="ch">彼所乘</span>. Lit., this expression means something like “carried by that” or “riding by that,” but I take it to mean that the previous contemplation is the way to truly know the path to the cessation of suffering, so I have translated it prosaically to English. It’s also a little doubtful to me that a word like <span class="ch">乘</span> was in the original Indic text. I can find no parallel word in the Sanskrit, and the two are otherwise very close parallels. Sarvāstivāda parallels do diverge at times, however, so I’ve preserved it in my translation in this way. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>Cultivating it leads to the next thing.</em> C. <span class="ch">修行彼向次法</span>, P. <em>tathā paṭipanno ca hoti anudhammacārī</em>, S. <em>tathā pratipannaś ca bhavaty anudharmacārī</em>.</p>
<p>SN 12.51 has a parallel for this expression, but the context is different because of the questions asked about each item of dependent origination: knowing the thing, its origin, its cessation, and the path to its cessation. This makes it much easier to read <em>anudharma</em> to mean “in line with” the path to cessation.</p>
<p>The term <em>anudharma</em> is usually interpreted to mean “in accord with the Dharma,” but in SĀ it instead appears to mean “the next thing (<em>dharma</em>)” in a progression, such as when disillusionment with something leads to lack of desire for it and then its cessation. Disillusionment, lack of desire, and cessation are each <em>dharma</em>s that progress in sequence, one leading to the next. I’ve translated these passages here as meaning that the practitioner moves forward to contemplate the next item in the chain of dependent origination, which will progress to ignorance. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>meritorious actions … demeritorious and unskillful actions … actions of nothingness.</em> C. <span class="ch">諸福行⋯諸不福不善行⋯無所有行</span>, P. <em>puññañce saṅkhāraṁ … apuññañce saṅkhāraṁ … āneñjañce saṅkhāraṁ</em>, S. <em>puṇyān abhisaṁskārān … apuṇyān apy ānijyān apy abhisaṁskārān</em>.</p>
<p>In the Theravāda tradition, <em>saṅkhāra</em> is understood here to refer to intentions or volitions to perform physical, verbal, and mental actions. In this context, the same term refers to the entire range of actions in Sarvāstivāda exegetical sources, so I have translated <span class="ch">行</span> in this straightforward way. They are typically presented as actions in previous lives that condition the awareness that arises in a new life. This suggests that the term S. <em>abhisaṁskāra</em> was interpreted as along the lines of “preparation” or “being formed,” but in practice it refers to past <em>karma</em> in this usage. Past <em>karma</em> shapes and forms the new life.</p>
<p>To give an example of the Sarvastivada reading of <em>abhisaṁskāra</em>, the <em>Dharmaskandha</em> defines meritorious actions quite broadly: “What is meritorious action? This refers to contaminated skillful physical actions, verbal actions, mind and mental functions, and volitions that aren’t associated with mind” (<span class="ch">云何福行？謂有漏善身業語業、心心所法、不相應行。</span> [<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1537_p0506a15" target="_blank">T1537.26.506a15</a>]). This would seem to be an Abhidharma way of including all three types of deeds. But where we would expect mental deeds we find the mind and everything included in the aggregate of volition. For those not versed in Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma, “volitions not associated with mind” (C. <span class="ch">不相應行</span>, S. <em>cittaviprayuktāḥ saṁskārāḥ</em>) was a catch-all for such things as the life force (i.e., S. <em>jīvitendriya</em>), which were not considered to be part of one’s mind but had no good category among the five aggregates.</p>
<p>The other oddity here in SĀ is the translation of the third type of action as “actions of nothingness” (or perhaps “no actions at all”) (<span class="ch">無所有行</span>). In other sources, including the S. parallel, this third type of action is called “immovable” or “imperturbable” (P. <em>āneñjaṃ</em>, S. <em>ānijyān</em>). These actions are also referred to as “actions that are not meritorious or demeritorious” in a passage below. In any case, this type of action is understood to refer to the practice of deep <em>samādhi</em>, specifically the four formless <em>samādhi</em>s. It was the highest type of contaminated action that a person could perform, which leads to rebirth in one of the formless heavens. There was a formless heaven of nothingness, and so perhaps this type of action was named after it here. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
