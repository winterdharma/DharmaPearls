<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 347 in the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition and no. 489 in Yinshun (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0096b25" target="_blank">T99.2.96b25-8a12</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/Y31n0030_p0060a06" target="_blank">Y30.60a6-4a12</a>). It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.70" target="_blank">SN 12.70</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from the usual observations comparing parallels found in the notes that follow, I’d like to draw the reader’s attention to the literary devices employed in this <em>sūtra</em>, which seem to form a simple type of chiamus.</p>
<p>The <em>sūtra</em> opens with a scene in which heretics plot to steal the Buddha’s teaching and use it to regain the honors and donations they were used to receiving. This would be a pleasant result for them in their imagination. The <em>sūtra</em> concludes with a story about a king sentencing a common thief to execution by repeated stabbing with lances. He indicates to Susīma that stealing the Dharma would have worse result. The moral to this tale, which rhetorically and stylistically forceful, is not in keeping with the Buddhist observation that wisdom is wisdom regardless of who teaches it.</p>
<p>The middle of the story also contains an inverse parallelism between Susīma’s questioning of the liberated monk(s) and the Buddha’s questioning of Susīma. In the first case, a mistaken questioner asks a series of questions, all of which presuppose the wrong cause for liberation (namely, meditative attainments rather than wisdom). As a result, all the questions are answered, “No.” In the second case, a correct questioner asks a series of questions that assert the correct cause for suffering to arise. Each question is answered, “Yes.”</p>
<p>The contrast between the two parallel conversations makes the story’s point more memorable to the listener, and it also is readily memorized since the bulk of it is a recitation of well-known rubrics. The moral to this part of the story is that miraculous or meditative attainments, while they may bring fame and power to a practitioner, are not the way to liberation. Nor are they the proper goal to pursue in the end.</p>
<p>I personally view these arguments as indicative of a text composed (perhaps written) during a later era when Buddhism came into sharp competition with other religious traditions like Brahminism and Jainism. It falls into the same category as many of the stories we find in DN and MN as rhetorical arguments against non-Buddhists in India at the time. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>This introduction is more involved that the one found in SN 12.70. There, Susīma is introduced as the leader of an assembly that beseeches him to go learn the Buddha’s teaching so they could impress the laity with it. This involves less back and forth than we find here, but this version is perhaps more plausible. As we shall see, the actual teaching by the Buddha in SN 12.70 is not abbreviated like it is here, meaning that it takes up more space in the story, while here the narrative surrounding that teaching is larger. This is a general pattern of the Theravāda <em>sutta</em>s: They feature more doctrine and less story overall compared to other Buddhist traditions.</p>
<p>One detail shared both here and reported in the Pali commentary is that the Buddha knew Susīma’s secret motive, but here he specifically tells the monks to make sure he attains liberation, and they agree. More than likely, these story elements were added to explain how an omniscient Buddha could be misled by someone from another sect. The Pali <em>sutta</em> may be closer to the original story in this regard. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>wise and great man.</em> C. <span class="ch">有智慧大力</span>. There is an older reading here that changes 大力 (“great power”) to <span class="ch">大士</span> (“great man”). We should note that when this part of the narrative is recounted in the next couple paragraphs, the expression becomes <span class="ch">聰明黠慧</span> (“astute and intelligent”). This may be the correct reading, which has been corrupted here. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>Susīma.</em> C. <span class="ch">須深</span> (EMC. siu-ʃɪəm = Pr. <em>suśim[a]</em>), G. ?, P. <em>susīma</em>, S. <em>susīma</em>. This name is attested in S. sources as the same as we find in the P. parallel of this <em>sūtra</em>. The C. transliteration suggests <em>suśima</em>. I have not found an attestation in G. sources. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>receive ordination.</em> C. <span class="ch">受具足</span>, P. <em>alattha upasampada</em>. C. <span class="ch">具足</span> typically means to be replete with or to perfect something. The Buddhist term for entering the order of renunciates is <em>upasampadā</em>, which lit. means to acquire or attain (the precepts). Thus, I’ve read <span class="ch">受具足</span> here as a lit. translation (“fully receive [the precepts]”), which was intended to mean “ordination” as a monk or nun. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p>This portion of the story varies considerably from the Pali parallel. In that version, Susīma only overhears some monks declaring themselves liberated to the Buddha. Then, Susīma asks a monk if he has attained the penetrating knowledges, namely the miraculous abilities, heavenly ear, knowing the thoughts of others, recollection of past lives, and the heavenly eye. Here, he asks if the monk had attained each of the four meditations.</p>
<p>At this point, however, both versions agree that he finishes with a question about the formless attainments, though here he seems to refer to both the four meditations and formless <em>samādhi</em>s.</p>
<p>The conclusion differs as well. In SN 35.70, Susīma says he doesn’t understand, but the monks dismiss his concerns. Here, Susīma accuses the monk of contradicting himself and making no sense. In both versions, he then goes to the Buddha to resolve the matter. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p>This questioning by Susīma implies that the practice of the four meditations and formless <em>samādhi</em>s was common knowledge to other religions besides the Buddhists. And it creates a subtext that these practices are not what made the Buddhists special, rather it was liberation through wisdom.</p>
<p>This doesn’t occur in SN 35.70 because there Susīma questions the monk about attainment of miraculous powers. This changes the subtext to that of the Buddhist deprecation of miracle-working. This is not surpising given how important the four meditations became in Theravāda Buddhism. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p>Again, this section of the story is lengthier outside of the doctrinal teaching given by the Buddha, and the teaching is much more involved in SN 35.70 than here.</p>
<p>In SN 35.70, the expression <em>dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇa</em> (<em>dhamma</em> + <em>ṭhiti</em> + <em>ñāṇa</em> = “knowledge of Dhamma living” or “<em>dhamma</em> persistence”) below is interpreted to mean the knowledge of the impermanence, painfulness, and selflessness of the five aggregates. Here, it has a much more holistic meaning of going into seclusion and contemplating carefully (or earnestly).</p>
<p>We get further confirmation of these two interpretations in their extant exegesis. The Pali commentary claims that the term refers to the intrinsic nature of things in general (i.e., that they are impermanent, etc.). This interprets <em>dhamma</em> as things like the five aggregates.</p>
<p>In the <cite>Yogācārabhūmi</cite>, we find the explanation of <span class="ch">法住智</span> (“knowledge of Dharma living”) as meaning someone who receives a teaching about dependent origination and then goes into retreat to contemplate it. When they penentrate it, they become a believer, and they gain knowledge of how things are established through cause and effect.</p>
<p>It would seem that this was a case of meaning being filled in at some later time by different commentators in each tradition. Neither explanation is wrong or incoherent, since both realizations are said to lead to liberation in other <em>sūtra</em>s. The takeaway may be that it need not be so specific. The knowledge gained through Dharma living, or the religious life, leads to <em>nirvāṇa</em>, not the specific attainments that Susīma expects must be involved.</p>
<p>Beyond this initial point, the two versions of the Buddha’s teaching proceed as we would expect. He then asks Susīma about the twelve-step chain of dependent origination: Does it necessarily involve the attainments that he had challenged the monks with in each version? Susīma concedes the point.
