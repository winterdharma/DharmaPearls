    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If a monk is unable to examine another’s mind well, he should examine his own mind well. He should train in that way. How does a monk examine his own mind well? If a monk were to perform this examination, he’d surely gain much from it: ‘Do I often act covetous, or do I often act without covetousness?’ ‘Do I often act hateful, or do I often act without hatefulness?’ ‘Do I often act ensnared in drowsiness, or do I often act without drowsiness?’ ‘Do I often act haughty, or do I often act without haughtiness?’ ‘Do I often act uncertainly or do I often act without uncertainty?’ ‘Do I often act violent, or do I often act without violence?’ ‘Do I often act with defiled thoughts, or do I often act without defiled thoughts?’ ‘Do I often act faithfully, or do I often act unfaithfully?’ ‘Do I often act energetically, or do I often act lazily?’ ‘Do I often act mindfully, or do I often act unmindfully?’ ‘Do I often act settled, or do I often act unsettled?’ ‘Do I often act with poor wisdom, or do I often act without poor wisdom?’<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></td>

He trains with utmost diligence, right mindfulness, right knowledge, and perseverance, not letting himself regress. He’s like a man with his hair and clothes on fire. He immediately seeks to put out his hair and clothes. Such is this monk who wants to cease these bad and unskillful qualities. He quickly pursues the method to do so.
