<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0435a24" target="_blank">T26.1.435a24-6a11</a>. It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.61" target="_blank">AN 3.61</a>.<br/>
The title of this <em>sūtra</em> was translated as <span class="ch">度</span> (“go beyond, liberate, freedom”), but <span class="ch">度</span> is often read as a simpler form of 渡 (“to ford a river”). This is confirmed when we observe that the Theravāda parallel is titled P. <em>titthāyatana</em>. Here, <em>tittha</em> is reasonably read in this context as meaning the tenets or doctrines of a religious sect, but the literal meaning is a “fording place” on a river. This is because Indian liberation religions used the metaphor of crossing a river or flood for the attainment of their ultimate goal. Thus, the truths or tenets that they claimed would achieve that goal were idiomatically called “fording places.” Given all of this, we can safely assume that 度 translates a cognate of P. <em>tittha</em> (cf. G. <em>tiṭ́ha</em> > S. <em>tīrtha</em>). I’ve maintained the literal reading to represent the C. translator’s intent.<br/>
In general, this <em>sūtra</em> is a close parallel to AN 3.61. There are, however, some significant differences in wording, and the AN version has an added section on eighteen mental preoccupations. Otherwise, the two texts are the same in their basic outline and content. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>everything a person does.</em> C. <span class="ch">人所為一切</span>, P. <em>yaṁ kiñcāyaṁ purisapuggalo paṭisaṁvedeti sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ vā sabbaṁ</em>. There is a divergence here with AN 3.61. The C. translation speaks of “everything done by a person” (<span class="ch">人所為一切</span>) while the P. speaks of “everything that a person experiences …” (<em>purisapuggalo paṭisaṁvedeti … sabbaṁ</em>). The passage reads the same aside from this alternation between <span class="ch">所為</span> and <em>paṭisaṁvedeti sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā adukkhamasukhaṁ</em>. The C. version seems to fit the larger context better given that the Buddha tells the holders of these views that they must break the cardinal precepts (presumably because they don’t take responsibility for their actions). Still, the Theravāda version makes sense in a more indirect way: A person might not take holding precepts seriously if they don’t think they are the cause of what they will experience. Essentially, the argument is one of free will vs. determinism or random fate. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>created by the Lord God.</em> C. <span class="ch">尊祐造</span>, P. <em>issara nimmāna</em>, S. <em>īśvara nirmāṇa</em>. <span class="ch">尊祐</span> lit. means “honored” or “excellent blessing.” This term also occurs in MĀ 18, 19, 28, 104, and 174. In MĀ 19, we find the term used in the similar context of discussing Jain beliefs. The other passages all involve a recitation of three heavenly figures, the sun, moon, and <span class="ch">尊祐</span>, making it clear that it was the name or title of a god.<br/>
Outside of MĀ, this particular term only occurs in two other C. texts: An older translation of a <em>prajñāpāramitā sūtra</em> (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T08n0221_p0068a17" target="_blank">T221.8.68a17</a>) and twice in a <em>samādhi sūtra</em> (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T15n0636_p0514a10" target="_blank">T636.15.514a10</a> & <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T15n0636_p0516c02" target="_blank">516c2</a>). All three of these cases appear to translate S. <em>bhagavān</em> in reference to the Buddha. In MĀ, however, S. <em>bhagavān</em> was translated as <span class="ch">眾祐</span> (“many blessings”) when it occurs in the context of the ten epithets.<br/>
The difficulty is that S. <em>īśvara</em> itself was often a superlative title for gods with similar interpretations as <em>bhagavān</em>, so C. translations of the two terms were somewhat interchangeable. A clearer C. trans. of <em>īśvara</em> was <span class="ch">尊豪</span>, which lit. means “honored and great,” or perhaps “supreme lord.” While <span class="ch">尊祐</span> bears some resemblance to translations of S. <em>bhagavān</em> (<span class="ch">世尊</span> and <span class="ch">衆祐</span>), it’s reasonable enough to assume the original passage here read the same as AN 3.61 and MN 101 (<em>issara nimmāna</em>). It’s possible that it was <em>bhagavān</em> rendered differently to disambiguate it as a title of a god instead of the Buddha. I’ve translated the passage assuming that <span class="ch">尊祐</span> translated S. <em>īśvara</em>, but the translator’s intention isn’t entirely clear to me. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4"><em>Venerables, if someone truly has the view that the cause of all this is created by previous lives, that would be an internal cause for them to do what shouldn’t be done. None of them would have any desire or make any effort.</em>. C. <span class="ch">諸賢，若一切皆因宿命造，見如真者，於內因內，作以不作，都無欲、無方便</span>, P. <em>pubbekataṁ kho pana, bhikkhave, sārato paccāgacchataṁ na hoti chando vā vāyāmo vā idaṁ vā karaṇīyaṁ idaṁ vā akaraṇīyanti</em>.<br/>
<span class="ch">作以不作</span> would appear to correspond with <em>idaṁ vā karaṇīyaṁ idaṁ vā akaraṇīyanti</em>, and <span class="ch">都無欲、無方便</span> corresponds with to <em>na hoti chando vā vāyāmo</em>, but 於內因內 doesn’t have a parallel in AN 3.61 that I can see. Its intended meaning is unclear.<br/>
A theory was proposed by the BDK translators that <span class="ch">因內</span> is a literary abbrev. of <span class="ch">因明</span> and <span class="ch">内明</span>. This might be plausible if we were reading native exegetical prose, but not so much in this context. It’s not uncommon for the translator of MĀ to render passages in overly literal ways that were nearly impenetrable in Chinese. In these situations, we have to guard against the impulse to assume a convenient meaning and then fashion a rationalization for it. Instead, we need to pay attention to what the original translator was likely to be rendering.<br/>
<span class="ch">內</span> most likely translated the equiv. of P. <em>ajjhatta</em> and <span class="ch">因</span> would be P. <em>hetu</em> or a word synomynous with it. When Buddhists speak of “internal” and “external” they usu. mean “self” vs. “other” or “oneself” vs. “the outside environment.” Using the term “internal” might serve to point out the irony that a view about external causes for bad behavior (i.e., past <em>karma</em> or a creator god) is actually an internal cause for that behavior. The Buddha’s point may be that these views would cause one to not take responsibility for their actions in the present. The same argument is repeated for the next two beliefs that effectively shift responsibility from the person doing these deeds. Thus, my best guess is that <span class="ch">於內因內</span> meant something like “an internal cause for oneself …” But here the Buddha is speaking theoretically of other people, so I translate the second <span class="ch">內</span> as “them.” [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n5"><em>no ascetic, priest, god like Māra or Brahmā, or any other worldly person can defeat, defile, or overcome this Dharma that I’ve  known and realized myself and teach for you.</em>. C. <span class="ch">我所自知、自覺法，為汝說者，若沙門、梵志，若天、魔、梵及餘世間皆無能伏，皆無能穢，皆無能制</span>, P. <em>ayaṁ kho pana, bhikkhave, mayā dhammo desito aniggahito asaṅkiliṭṭho anupavajjo appaṭikuṭṭho samaṇehi brāhmaṇehi viññūhi.</em><br/>
While these two statements in C. and P. are essentially the same, there are notable differences in wording. AN 3.61 only mentions ascetics and priests, while this version expands that part of the statement to be all inclusive of gods and any other person.<br/>
Also, the first two verbs in this version correspond well enough to those in AN 3.61: <span class="ch">無能伏</span> (“none can defeat”) ≈ <em>aniggahito</em> (“irrefutable”) and <span class="ch">無能穢</span> (“none can defile”) ≈ <em>asaṅkiliṭṭho</em> (“undefiled, uncorrupted”). However, <span class="ch">無能制</span> (“none can overcome”) doesn’t match either <em>anupavajjo</em> (“blameless, beyond reproach”) or <em>appaṭikuṭṭho</em> (“not scorned, not disapproved”).<br/>
It would seem that both versions have added content in different but harmless ways. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n6"><em>six senses … six elements.</em>. AN 3.61 adds eighteen mental preoccupations (<em>aṭṭhārasa manopavicārā</em>) and the four noble truths (<em>cattāri ariyasaccāni</em>) to this list of subjects to be defined. The four noble truths are brought up later in this version, but they aren’t announced as a subject to be covered in this passage. The eighteen preoccupations are the happiness, sadness, and indifference (<em>somanassa</em>, <em>domanassa</em>, and <em>upekkhā</em>) that result from each of the six types of sense experience (i.e., three feelings x six senses = eighteen preoccupations). [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n7"><em>principle of the six senses.</em>. C. <span class="ch">六處法</span>, P. <em>phassāyatanāni</em>. This version diverges a bit from AN 3.61. While the underlying word that <span class="ch">處</span> trans. is no doubt a cognate of P. <em>āyatanāni</em>, AN 3.61 went in a different direction, qualifying the <em>āyatanāni</em> as “places of contact,” which are the same six senses. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n8"><em>as a result of these six elements, the six senses exist.</em>. C. <span class="ch">因六界便有六處</span>, P. <em>okkantiyā sati nāmarūpaṁ, nāmarūpapaccayā saḷāyatanaṁ</em>. AN 3.61 inserts name and form (<em>nāmarūpa</em>) as the antecedent of the six senses, whereas this version does not. We should note that the six elements could be considered equivalent to name and form since they include the four material elements and awareness. Sarvāstivādins defined name as the four formless aggregates and considered awareness to imply the other three formless aggregates (i.e., feeling, conception, and volition) as being present as well. This might explain why name and form is missing in this passage. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n9"><em>if someone has feeling, then they will truly know suffering …</em>. C. <span class="ch">若有覺者便知苦如真⋯</span>, P. <em>vediyamānassa kho panāhaṁ, bhikkhave, idaṁ dukkhanti paññapemi …</em>. This version reads awkwardly, as it seems to imply that anyone who is subject to feeling will come to know the four noble truths. AN 3.61 reads differently: The Buddha teaches the four noble truths for such people. The difference is in the verbs that take the noble truths as their object. The C. passage has “to truly know” (≈ S. <em>yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti</em>) where AN 3.61 has “to teach, declare” (P. <em>paññapemi</em>). Both share the same root (S. <em>prajñā</em>, P. <em>pañña</em>), so it’s conceivable that a phonetic change or conflation is responsible for the different readings.<br/>
AN 3.61 certainly seems to make better sense here. Taken literally, this version in MĀ is reminescent of the later Buddhist idea that suffering inevitably leads to awakening as beings cycling through <em>saṃsāra</em> endlessly are certain to (eventually) encounter the Dharma, practice it, and escape rebirth.

<li id="n11">AN 3.61 also defines the cessation of suffering as the twelve-step chain of dependent cessation that begins with the cessation of ignorance. [<a href="#ref11">back</a>]</li>
