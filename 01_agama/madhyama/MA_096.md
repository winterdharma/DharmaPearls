<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0577c15" target="_blank">T26.1.577c15-8a25</a>. Its parallel is <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.55" target="_blank">AN 10.55</a>, but it shares more in common with <a href="MA_095.html" target="_blank">MĀ 95</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.53" target="_blank">AN 10.53</a>.</p>
<p>The title of this <em>sūtra</em> reads simply as <span class="ch">無</span> (“nothing” or “having no”), which might be a reading of a word similar to AN 10.55’s title, but the C. trans. of <em>parihāna</em> (“decline, regress”) would instead be <span class="ch">衰退</span>. I’ve chosen to read <span class="ch">無</span> in the way it’s used in the body of the <em>sūtra</em>, which is to mean “having no” unskillful qualities.</p>
<p>This <em>sūtra</em> and AN 10.55 have somewhat differently worded introductions, yet they contain the same keywords and meaning. Afterward, Śāriputra gives the same teaching as the one given by the Buddha in MĀ 95, as the final three paragraphs in both <em>sūtra</em>s are nearly identical. The parallel to this <em>sūtra</em>, AN 10.55, has a different teaching in which the practitioner assesses their skillful rather than unskillful qualities. As a result, it is only a similar parallel. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>AN 10.55 has a more verbose introduction in which Śāriputra announcing the topics that he would be discussing for an assembly of monk. This <em>sūtra</em> begins at the point when he defines what being liable to decline means. Despite these differences, we can see that both include four specific points describing a person’s grasp of the Dharma: hearing Dharma that they haven’t heard yet (<span class="ch">未聞法者得聞</span>, <em>assutañceva dhammaṁ suṇāti</em>), not forgetting the Dharma they’ve heard (<span class="ch">已聞法者不忘失</span>, <em>sutā cassa dhammā na sammosaṁ gacchanti</em>), reciting or rehearsing the Dharma (<span class="ch">若使有法本所修行、廣布、誦習</span>, <em>ye cassa dhammā pubbe cetaso asamphuṭṭhapubbā te cassa samudācaranti</em>), and understanding it (<span class="ch">慧之所解</span>, <em>aviññātañceva vijānāti</em>). These points are worded differently in these two versions, but we can see the basic commonality: hearing, not forgetting, rehearsing, and understanding. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p>This list of qualities is verbatim of that found in <a href="MA_095.html" target="_blank">MĀ 95</a>. See the notes to that <em>sūtra</em> for a detailed discussion of my translation here. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>no energy</em>. C. <span class="ch">無進</span>. I’ve read <span class="ch">進</span> as an abbreviation of <span class="ch">精進</span> (≈ P. <em>āraddhaviriya</em> in MĀ 95/AN 10.53). [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
