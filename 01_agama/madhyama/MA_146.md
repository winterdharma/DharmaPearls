## Chapter 12: The Brahmins
### 146. Parable of the Elephant’s Footprint (2)

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){: #ref1} One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
{:#p1}

#### Pilotika’s Parable

2\. The wanderer Pilotika left Śrāvastī at daybreak and went to the Buddha, paid homage by prostrating to him, and withdrew to sit to one side. The Buddha explained the teaching for him, encouraging, rousing, and making him rejoice. After he explained the teaching using measureless methods and encouraging, rousing, and making him rejoice, the Buddha fell silent and waited. Pilotika then bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, circled him three times, and departed.
{:#p2}

3\. The priest Jātiśroṇa[\[2\]](#n2){: #ref2} was then riding in his beautiful white chariot accompanied by 500 disciples. They left Śrāvastī at daybreak to go a quiet place where he would instruct his disciples in reciting the scriptures. The priest Jātiśroṇa saw Pilotika ahead and asked him, “Vatsāyana, where are you coming from this morning?”
{:#p3}

Pilotika replied, “Priest, I’m returning from paying homage and giving support to the Bhagavān.”

4\. Jātiśroṇa asked, “Vatsāyana, would you happen to know the wisdom that the ascetic Gautama studies in that empty and peaceful place?”
{:#p4}

5\. Pilotika replied, “Priest, who can know the wisdom that the ascetic Gautama studies in that empty and peaceful place? Priest, if someone knew the wisdom that the ascetic Gautama studies in that empty and peaceful place, they would be like him. But, priest, I’ve only read about four points of meaning from scripture. As a result of those four points of meaning, I believe the Bhagavān is a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One. The teaching that the Bhagavān explains is good, and the Tathāgata’s disciples are a noble assembly that’s well destined.
{:#p5}

6\. “Priest, it’s like a skilled elephant trainer who wanders in a quiet place. Among the trees of the forest, he sees the footprint of a large elephant. Seeing it, he believes it belongs to a huge elephant. I’m likewise, priest. I read about four points of meaning in scripture. As a result of those four points of meaning, I believe the Bhagavān is a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One. The teaching that he explains is good, and the Tathāgata’s disciples are a noble assembly that’s well destined.
{:#p6}

7\. “What are those four points of meaning? Priest, there are wise warrior philosophers who are learned and certain. They defeat worldly men [in debate], and there’s nothing they don’t know. They create treatises with these views and travel the world. They think, ‘We’ll visit the ascetic Gautama and ask about such-and-such a topic. If he can answer, then we’ll ask another question. If he can’t answer, then he’ll be defeated, and we’ll depart.’ They hear that the Bhagavān has traveled to a certain town, and so they go to visit him there. Upon seeing the Bhagavān, they don’t dare question him, so how could they defeat him? Priest, I’ve read scriptures and thereby ascertained this first point of meaning. As a result of this meaning, I believe the Bhagavān is a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One. The teaching that he explains is good, and the Tathāgata’s disciples are a noble assembly that’s well destined.
{:#p7}

8\. “In this way, there are wise priest … householder … ascetic philosophers who are learned and certain. They defeat worldly men, and there’s nothing they don’t know. They create treatises with these views and travel the world. They think, ‘We’ll visit the ascetic Gautama and ask about such-and-such a topic. If he can answer, then we’ll ask another question. If he can’t answer, then he’ll be defeated, and we’ll depart.’ They hear that the Bhagavān has traveled to a certain town, and so they go to visit him there. Upon seeing the Bhagavān, they don’t dare question him, so how could they defeat him? Priest, I’ve read scripture and thereby ascertained this fourth point of meaning. As a result of this meaning, I believe the Bhagavān is a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One. The teaching that he explains is good, and the Tathāgata’s disciples are a noble assembly that’s well destined.
{:#p8}

9\. “Priest, I’ve read scripture with these four points of meaning. As a result of these four points of meaning, I believe the Bhagavān is a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One. The teaching that he explains is good, and the Tathāgata’s disciples are a noble assembly that’s well destined.”
{:#p9}

10\. Jātiśroṇa said, “Vatsāyana, you support the ascetic Gautama a great deal. What’s the cause and what’s the reason that you rejoice and approve of him?”

Pilotika replied, “So it is, priest! So it is! I support the Bhagavān a great deal, and I praise him a great deal. The whole world should support him, too!”

#### The Complete Parable

11\. After hearing these points of meaning, Jātiśroṇa dismounted his chariot and knelt on his right knee with his palms together facing Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove. He paid homage three times: “Devotion to the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One!” After doing this three times, he got back on his beautiful white chariot and went to Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove. When he arrived at the chariot grounds, he dismounted and proceeded to the Buddha on foot. He exchanged greetings with him and withdrew to sit to one side.
{:#p11}

12\. Jātiśroṇa then recounted his conversation with Pilotika for the Buddha in its entirety. After he heard it, the Bhagavān said, “Priest, Pilotika explained the parable of the elephant’s footprint, but he didn’t tell it very well, and it was incomplete. Here is the parable of the elephant’s footprint told well and completely. I’ll explain it for you, so listen well to it.
{:#p12}

13\. “Priest, suppose a skilled elephant trainer wanders in a peaceful place and sees among the trees a large elephant footprint. Seeing it, he believes that it belongs to a huge elephant. Priest, that skilled elephant trainer might not feel confident about it. There’s also an elephant mother named [Kaṇerukā] in the forest. She’s tall and huge, and she possesses such a footprint. Searching for this footprint, the trainer again sees that large elephant print. Seeing it, he believes that the footprint belongs to [another] huge elephant.
{:#p13}

14\. “Priest, that skilled elephant trainer still might not feel confident. There’s another elephant mother named [Kāḷārikā] in the forest. She’s very tall and huge, and she possesses such a footprint. Searching for this footprint, the trainer again sees a large elephant print. Seeing it, he believes that the footprint belongs to [another] huge elephant.
{:#p14}

15\. “Priest, that skilled elephant trainer still might not feel confident. There’s another elephant mother named [Vāmanikā] in this forest. She’s very tall and huge, and she possesses such a footprint. Searching for this footprint, he again sees a large elephant print. Seeing it, he believes that the footprint belongs to a huge elephant. After searching for this footprint, he sees that this large elephant print is very long and wide, circular, and sunk into the earth, and he sees that elephant, either when it’s coming, going, standing, or walking. Perhaps it’s standing up or lying down. After he sees that elephant, the trainer thinks, ‘If it has the same footprint, that surely is the huge elephant!’
{:#p15}

16\. “Thus, priest, a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One arises in the world who’s accomplished in knowledge and conduct, well gone, an understander of the world, an unsurpassed man, a trainer in the principles of the path, a teacher to gods and humans, and called the Buddha, the Blessed One. Among the gods, Māra, Brahmā, ascetics, and priests of this world, from humans up to the gods, he accomplishes and dwells in his own knowledge, awakening, and direct experience. He truly knows: ‘Birth has been ended, the religious practice has been established, the task has been accomplished, and I will not again be subject to existence.’
{:#p16}

17\. “He explains a teaching that’s wonderful in the beginning, middle, and end. Both its meaning and words are complete and pure, and it demonstrates the religious practice. When he explains the teaching to a householder or a householder’s son, they become faithful after hearing it.
{:#p17}

#### Going Forth

18\. “After they have faith in the Tathāgata’s correct teaching and discipline, they think, ‘A home becomes cramped, a place of dust and toil; leaving home and training on the path reveals a clear expanse. Now, I’m confined at home, and I’m confining. I’m not able to fully live and cultivate the religious life. Wouldn’t it be better to discard this small or large amount of wealth and these few or many friends and family? I’ll shave off my hair and beard, put on the reddish-brown robes, become a believer, and leave home to train on the path in homelessness.’
{:#p18}

19\. “Sometime later, he discards his small or large amount of wealth and few or many friends and family. He shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the reddish-brown robes, becomes a believer, and leaves home to train on the path in homelessness. After leaving home and discarding his family, he accepts the monk’s training, cultivates the precepts, and guards himself from acting freely. Moreover, he well attends to his behavior and the rules of propriety. Seeing the smallest misdeeds and constantly fearing them, he upholds the training and precepts.
{:#p19}

#### The Twenty Renunciations

20\. “He parts with killing, stops killing, and he discards blades and bludgeons. With conscience and modesty and with kindness and compassion, he’s beneficial to all beings, even insects and worms. He purifies his mind and rids it of killing beings.

25\. “He parts with coarse speech and stops coarse speech. If something said is in expression or feeling coarse and mean, bad sounding and disagreeable to the ear, that displeases many and isn’t loved by many, that causes others to suffer, or that makes samādhi impossible, he stops such words. If some expression is clear, peaceful, and flexible, that agrees with the ear and enters the mind, that’s pleasing and lovely, that causes the well-being of others, that uses words and sounds that are completely understandable, that doesn’t cause people to be frightened, and that allows others to concentrate, then he speaks such words.

{:#p39}

#### The Stages of Training

40\. “After he accomplishes this group of noble precepts, he again has to practice being quite satisfied, taking clothing to cover himself and food to fill his body. Wherever he goes, he has his robes and bowl, traveling without a care like a hawk flying through the sky with a pair of wings.
{:#p40}

41\. “After he accomplishes this group of noble precepts and is quite satisfied, he also guards his faculties. He accomplishes being constantly mindful and closed off, mindfully wanting clear understanding, and guarding that mindful state of mind. He continuously produces correct knowing.
{:#p41}

42\. “If his eye sees forms, he still doesn’t accept those perceptions and doesn’t partake of the forms. That is, because of resentment and arguing, he guards the eye faculty, and then longing, grief, and bad and unskillful things won’t arise in his mind. Because it leads to them, he guards the eye faculty. Thus, if his ear … nose … tongue … body … If his mind knows things, he still doesn’t accept those perceptions and doesn’t partake of those things. That is, because of resentment and arguing, he guards the mind faculty, and then longing, grief, and bad and unskillful things won’t arise in his mind. Because it leads to them, he guards the mind faculty.
{:#p42}

43\. “After he accomplishes this group of noble precepts, is quite satisfied, and guards his faculties, he again has to learn correct knowing of exiting and entering. Well observing and discerning while bending and stretching or rising and sitting down, his behavior and expression are serene. He wears his outer and inner robes and holds his bowl well. While walking, standing, sitting, lying down, sleeping, waking, speaking, and remaining silent, he correctly knows them.
{:#p43}

44\. “After he accomplishes this group of noble precepts, is quite satisfied, guards his faculties, and correctly knows exiting and entering, he again lives secluded in a peaceful place. It might be under a tree, in an empty and peaceful dwelling, or in a mountain cave. Sometimes it’s on bare ground or a pile of straw. Perhaps he goes to a forest, or maybe he stays in a cemetery.
{:#p44}

45\. “After he’s staying in a peaceful place, perhaps under a tree or in an empty and peaceful dwelling, he spreads out his sitting mat and sits down crossed-legged. With correct posture and correct intent, he avoids what’s contrary to mindfulness and puts a stop to longing. Without any arguing, he sees another’s property and requirements for living without longing or wanting them for himself. He purifies his mind and rids it of longing. Thus … hatred … drowsiness … regret … doubt. It not having any resemblance to good qualities, he purifies his mind and rids it of doubt.
{:#p45}

46\. “After he has stopped these five hindrances and mental defilements that weaken wisdom, he’s secluded from desires and secluded from bad and unskillful things. While he notices and examines things, this seclusion produces joy and happiness in him, and he accomplishes and dwells in the first meditation.
{:#p46}

47\. “Priest, this is what’s exhausted by the Tathāgata, what’s practiced by the Tathāgata, and what’s worn by the Tathāgata. Still, this isn’t entirely what makes the Bhagavān a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One, nor why the Bhagavān’s teaching is good and the Tathāgata’s disciples are a noble assembly that’s well destined.
{:#p47}

48\. “Once noticing and examining things has subsided, he has inner calm and a unified mind. Without noticing or examining things, this <em>samādhi</em> produces joy and happiness, and he accomplishes and dwells in the second meditation.
{:#p48}

49\. “Priest, this is what’s exhausted by the Tathāgata, what’s practiced by the Tathāgata, and what’s worn by the Tathāgata. Still, this isn’t entirely what makes the Bhagavān a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One, nor why the Bhagavān’s teaching is good and the Tathāgata’s disciples are a noble assembly that’s well destined.
{:#p49}

50\. “Parting with desire for that joy, he lives in equanimity and pursues nothing. With right mindfulness and right knowledge, he personally experiences happiness, about which the noble ones teach him the noble’s happy abiding place of detachment and mindfulness. He accomplishes and dwells in the third meditation.
{:#p50}

51\. “Priest, this is what’s exhausted by the Tathāgata, what’s practiced by the Tathāgata, and what’s worn by the Tathāgata. Still, this isn’t entirely what makes the Bhagavān a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One, nor why the Bhagavān’s teaching is good and the Tathāgata’s disciples are a noble assembly that’s well destined.
{:#p51}

52\. “His pleasure ceases and their pain ceases. His past joy and sorrow having ceased, he feels neither pain nor pleasure. With the purification of his equanimity and mindfulness, he accomplishes and dwells in the fourth meditation.
{:#p52}

53\. “Priest, this is what’s exhausted by the Tathāgata, what’s practiced by the Tathāgata, and what’s worn by the Tathāgata. Still, this isn’t entirely what makes the Bhagavān a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One, nor why the Bhagavān’s teaching is good and the Tathāgata’s disciples are a noble assembly that’s well destined.
{:#p53}

54\. “After he attains a concentrated mind in this way, he is pure, undefiled, untroubled, flexible, and abides well. He attains an imperturbable mind that’s headed for the end of contaminants and realization of the penetrating knowledges.
{:#p54}

55\. “He truly knows, ‘This is suffering.’ He truly knows, ‘This is the formation of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the path to the cessation of suffering.’ He truly knows, ‘These are contaminants’ … ‘This is the formation of contaminants’ … ‘This is the cessation of contaminants’ … ‘This is the path to the cessation of contaminants.’
{:#p55}

56\. “Knowing and seeing in this way, his mind is liberated from the contaminants of desire and liberated from the contaminants of existence and ignorance. Once he’s liberated, he readily knows that he’s liberated. He truly knows: ‘Birth has been ended, the religious practice has been established, the task has been accomplished, and I will not again be subject to existence.’
{:#p56}

57\. “Priest, this is what’s exhausted by the Tathāgata, what’s practiced by the Tathāgata, and what’s worn by the Tathāgata. Still, this isn’t entirely what makes the Bhagavān a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One, nor why the Bhagavān’s teaching is good and the Tathāgata’s disciples are a noble assembly that’s well destined.
{:#p57}

#### Conclusion

58\. “Priest, what do you think? Is this parable of the elephant’s footprint in this way well told and complete?”
{:#p58}

Jātiśroṇa replied, “Indeed, Gautama! The parable of the elephant’s footprint is in this way well told and complete.”

59\. The priest Jātiśroṇa said, “Bhagavān, I have known it. Sugata, I have understood it. Bhagavān, now I take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha of monks. Please, Bhagavān, accept me as a layman. From today until the end of my life, I’ll devote myself [to the precepts].”
{:#p59}

60\. This is what the Buddha said. When the priest Jātiśroṇa and the wanderer Pilotika heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.

1. {:#n1} For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0656a14" target="_blank">T26.1.656a14-8a27</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is parallel to [MN 27](https://suttacentral.net/mn27){: target="_blank"}. A large part (§ [18-56](#p18)) of this sūtra is also parallel with MĀ 80 (§ [14-43](..\..\02_madhyama\02_Lesser_Lands_and_Cities\07_King_Dirghayu\MA_080.md#p14){: target="_blank"} and § [55](..\..\02_madhyama\02_Lesser_Lands_and_Cities\07_King_Dirghayu\MA_080.md#p55){: target="_blank"}) and a couple other MĀ sūtras that recite the gradual path. The main difference between these two sūtras is that MĀ 80 gives a full description of the supernormal powers, while MĀ 146 gives a full description of the four meditations. This material is itself parallel to the stock description of a monk’s training found in several Pali suttas including MN 27. [\[back\]](#ref1)
