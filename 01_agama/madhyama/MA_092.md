<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0574c01" target="_blank">T26.1.574c1-5a18</a>. Its direct parallels are <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.23" target="_blank">AN 10.23</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.94" target="_blank">SN 22.94</a>. It shares the same initial sermon with AN 10.23 but then concludes with the metaphor of the lotus flower that concludes SN 22.94. The list of defilements is closer to that found in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn40" target="_blank">MN 40</a> and MĀ 183 than the one found in AN 10.23-24, but the two versions appear to be variants of the same list. See the notes below for more details on these points. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Longing … contentiousness … malice … fits of rage … not admitting [other’s virtues] … fixation … stinginess … jealousy … deception … fraud … lack of modesty … lack of conscience … bad desires … bad views.</em> C. <span class="ch">增伺⋯諍訟⋯恚恨⋯瞋纏⋯不語⋯結⋯慳⋯嫉⋯欺誑⋯諛諂⋯無慙⋯無愧⋯惡欲⋯惡見</span>. The separation of this list into fourteen items is based on the passages in MĀ 183 that treats each separately (see below).<br/>
A similar list of ten defilements is found at AN 10.23-24 that reads <em>lobha … dosa … moha … kodha … upanāha … makkha … paḷāsa … macchariya … pāpikā issā … pāpikā icchā</em>. A parallel set of twelve defilements is also found in MN 40: <em>abhijjhā … byāpāda … kodha … upanāha … makkha … paḷāsa … issā … macchariya … sāṭheyyā … māyā … pāpikā icchā … micchādiṭṭhi</em>. A parallel to this list occurs in MĀ 183: <span class="ch">貪伺⋯恚⋯瞋⋯不語⋯結⋯慳⋯嫉⋯諛諂⋯欺誑⋯無慙⋯無愧⋯惡欲⋯邪見</span>. We can surmise, then, that there were at least three versions of this list of defilements, with some minor discrepancies in their different witnesses.<br/>
Many of the defilements in these lists were incorporated into the later Abhidharma rubric of “secondary afflictions” (S. <em>upakleśa</em>). These earlier <em>sūtra</em> lists don’t show much direct influence from this Abhidharma rubric, given that they include major afflictions as well as secondary ones. The most distinctive feature of these lists in MĀ 92 and AN 10.23-24 is that they end with defilements described as <span class="ch">惡</span> (P. <em>pāpikā</em>, “bad”).<br/>
In MN 40 and MĀ 183, the last item was changed to wrong view (<span class="ch">邪見</span>, <em>micchādiṭṭhi</em>). MĀ 92 seems to represent an in-between stage of this change, having bad view (<span class="ch">惡見</span>, <em>pāpikādiṭṭhi</em>) as its last item. Its version of the list also begins the same as the MN version. Thus, MĀ 92 appears to be a hybrid of AN 10.23 and MN 40 that contains the sermon in AN and a variant of the list of defilements in MN.<br/>
Deciphering the individual items in this list of defilements is helped by consulting MĀ 183 and MN 40, which represent two sectarian versions of the same. A few of the C. translations are overly literal or otherwise unclear. Below are notes about my translation of each:<br/>
<em>longing.</em> C. <span class="ch">增伺</span>, P. <em>abhijjhā</em>, S. <em>abhidhyā</em>. The C. here is typically understood as a lit. trans. of <em>abhi-</em> (<span class="ch">增</span>) and <em>-dhyā</em> (<span class="ch">伺</span>), meaning “excessive searching.” The term is translated as <span class="ch">貪伺</span> in MĀ 183, and this passage has a variant reading that amends <span class="ch">增</span> to <span class="ch">貪</span>. <span class="ch">貪伺</span> lit. means “greedy searching.” In either case, the intended reading would seem to be “intense desire” or “longing.”<br/>
<em>contentiousness.</em> C. <span class="ch">諍訟</span>, P. <em>paḷāsa</em>, S. <em>pradāsa</em>. This defilement is otherwise missing from the other C. parallels. It seems likely to correspond to P. <em>paḷāsa</em> or one of its synonyms. The C. lit. means “fighting, quarrelling.”<br/>
<em>malice.</em> C. <span class="ch">恚恨</span>, P. <em>byāpāda</em>, S. <em>vyāpāda</em>. The C. lit. means “angry resentment.”<br/>
<em>fits of rage.</em> C. <span class="ch">瞋纏</span>, P. <em>kodha</em>, S. <em>krodha</em>. The C. lit. means “wrapped in anger.” It’s possible the term here was S. <em>krodha paryavasthāna</em>, which meant “possessed by rage” (i.e., an episode of demonic possession). The term <em>paryavasthāna</em>, however, was sometimes interpreted to mean “wrapped up” or “ensnared” by both Chinese and Tibetan translators, as was the case here. I’ve translated it colloquilly as “fits of rage.”<br/>
<em>not admitting [other’s virtues].</em> C. <span class="ch">不語</span>, P. <em>makkha</em>?, S. <em>mrakṣa</em>?. This C. translation seems very strange, but there was apparently a reading of the S. verb <em>mrakṣayati</em> as “speaking indistinctly or incorrectly.” In the P. tradition, <em>makkha</em> has a lit. meaning of “smearing” or “dirtying” which is extended to refer to “disparaging” others, just as done in English. It was usu. a counterpart to <em>pradāsa</em>, meaning to “disparage” other people to minimize their good qualities. <em>Pradāsa</em>, on the other hand, is the concealment of one’s own faults. Together, they describe hypocrisy. My translation assumes the C. must refer to a reading like this, but it’s unclear.<br/>
<em>fixation.</em> C. <span class="ch">結</span>, P. <em>upanāha</em>, S. <em>upanāha</em>. In the context of these defilements, <em>upanāha</em> is understood to mean a binding enmity that someone is unable to relinquish for a long time. <em>Upanāha</em> had other unrelated uses, however, because its lit. meaning was “a tie” or “binding.” Here, the C. translation reflected this lit. meaning, where 結 means “a tie” or “bondage.” I’ve translated it here as “fixation,” intending the meaning of someone who has an unhealthy obsession.<br/>
<em>stinginess.</em> C. <span class="ch">慳</span>, P. <em>macchariya</em>, S. <em>mātsarya</em>. This and the next term are usually paired together to represent a type of selflish disregard or dislike of others. One is the unwillingness to be generous, and the other is dislike of another’s fortune.<br/>
<em>jealousy.</em> C. <span class="ch">嫉</span>, P. <em>issā</em>, S. <em>īrṣyā</em>.<br/>
<em>deception.</em> C. <span class="ch">欺誑</span>, P. <em>sāṭheyyā</em>, S. <em>śāṭhya</em>.<br/>
<em>fraud.</em> C. <span class="ch">諛諂</span>, P. <em>māyā</em>, S. <em>māyā</em>.<br/>
<em>lack of modesty.</em> C. <span class="ch">無慙</span>, P. <em>ahiri</em>, S. <em>ahrī</em>. There is very little difference in the meaning of this and next term in C., and it could be argued that there isn’t in the Indic terms, either. Traditionally, one is defined as the lack of a personal sense of morality, and the other is a disregard for social conventions of propriety. Essentially, they both mean “shamelessness.”<br/>
<em>lack of conscience.</em> C. <span class="ch">無愧</span>, P. <em>anottappa</em>, S. <em>anapatrapa</em>.<br/>
<em>bad wishes.</em> C. <span class="ch">惡欲</span>, P. <em>pāpikā icchā</em>, S. <em>pāpika icchā</em>. AN 10.23 gives us a gloss of this term, saying that it means a person who wants to be known as possessing a virtue that they know they do not.<br/>
<em>bad views.</em> C. <span class="ch">惡見</span>, P. <em>pāpikā diṭṭhi</em>, S. <em>pāpika dṛṣṭi</em>. The precise meaning intended here is not clear, but there are glosses in other contexts. For example, AN 10.104 glosses bad view as the viewpoint that results from following the wrong eightfold path, which in turn leads “to what is unlikable, undesirable, disagreeable, harmful, and suffering” (P. <em>aniṭṭhāya akantāya amanāpāya ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattanti</em>). Thus, “bad” views are those that lead to the bad results of bad actions that they motivate. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>Take for example … don’t cling to him.</em>. C. <span class="ch">猶如青蓮華⋯紅赤⋯白蓮花，水生水長，出水上，不著水。如是，如來世間生、世間長，出世間行，不著世間法</span>.<br/>
Compare this passage with the conclusion of SN 22.94: “Suppose there was a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Though it sprouted and grew in the water, it would rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to it. In the same way, though I was born and grew up in the world, I live having mastered the world, unsullied by the world.” (<em>Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, uppalaṁ vā padumaṁ vā puṇḍarīkaṁ vā udake jātaṁ udake saṁvaḍḍhaṁ udakā accuggamma ṭhāti anupalittaṁ udakena; evameva kho, bhikkhave, tathāgato loke jāto loke saṁvaḍḍho lokaṁ abhibhuyya viharati anupalitto lokenā”ti.</em>) [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
