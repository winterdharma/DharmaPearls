    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana and a group of monks had assembled in the discussion hall after the midday meal to do some task.

    <td id='p3'>3. Thereupon, Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana questioned that Jain about this topic: “Vāṣpa, what do you think? If a monk guards his body, speech, and mind, do you think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife?”</td>

    <td id='p5'>5. At that time, the Bhagavān was sitting in a quiet place. Using his heavenly ear that goes beyond that of humans, he heard Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana and that Jain disciple of the Śākya tribe named Vāṣpa having this conversation. Having overheard them, the Bhagavān rose from his seat of repose that afternoon and went to the discussion hall. He prepared a seat in front of the assembled monks and sat down. Once he was seated, the Bhagavān asked, “Maudgalyāyana, what were you discussing with this Jain disciple of the Śākya tribe named Vāṣpa? And what was the reason for your meeting here in the discussion hall?”</td>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0434a12" target="_blank">T26.1.434a12-5a23</a>. It’s parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.195" target="_blank">AN 4.195</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Śākya people.</em> C. <span class="ch">釋羇瘦</span> (EMC. ʃɪɛk-kɪĕ-ṣïəu = Pr. <em>śakeṣu</em>?), P. <em>sakkesu</em>. This is the translit. of a term that means the people of Śākya. The English equivalent would be Śākyans, just as “Americans” means “people of America.”<br/>
<em>Kapilavastu.</em> C. <span class="ch">迦維羅衛</span> (EMC. kă-yiui-la-ɦɪuɛi = G. <em>Ka’ilava[stu]</em>?), P. <em>kapilavatthu</em>. This was the capital of the Śākya lands.<br/>
<em>banyan tree park.</em> C. <span class="ch">尼拘類園</span> (EMC. nei-kɪu-lɪui + “park” = Pr. <em>nigro[dha]</em>? + <em>arama</em>), P. <em>nigrodhārāma</em>, S. <em>nyagrodhārāma</em>. The name of the banyan tree (presumably Pr. <em>nigrodha</em>) was translit. to C. This was a park near Kapilavastu. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>Jain</em>. C. <span class="ch">尼乾</span> (EMC. nei-kan = Pr. <em>nigan[tha]</em>), G. <em>nigaṭ́ha</em>, P. <em>nigaṇṭha</em>, S. <em>nirgrantha</em>. Nirgranthajñāniputra was the founder of the religion that is today known as Jainism. His disciples were known generally as Nirgranthas in Buddhist texts (which lit. means “mendicant” or “unhindered”), which was usu. translit. in C. I’ve used the modern name for clarity. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4"><em>Vāṣpa</em>. C. <span class="ch">惒破</span> (EMC. ɦua-p‘ua = Pr. <em>vapa</em>), G. <em>vapa</em>?, P. <em>vappa</em>, S. <em>vāṣpa</em>. This Jain disciple’s name lit. meant “planting” in Pali. I’ve adopted a S. equiv. The name was also sometimes written <em>bāṣpa</em> in BHS sources according to Edgerton. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n5"><em>Suppose a monk creates unskillful physical actions that were contaminants, afflictions, fevers, and griefs.</em>. C. <span class="ch">若有比丘生不善身行，漏、煩、熱、憂慼</span>, P. <em>ye kāyasamārambhapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā vighātapariḷāhā</em>. The P. phrasing is generalized (“whoever” instead of “a monk”), but <em>āsavā vighāta pariḷāhā</em> appears directly parallel with <span class="ch">漏、煩、熱</span>. There is a functional equivalence between <span class="ch">生</span> … <span class="ch">身行</span> and P. <em>kāyasamārambhapaccayā</em>, but <em>samārambha</em> applied to body, speech, and mind is peculiar to AN 4.195. It seems to refer not simply to actions but to ascetic practices designed to extirpate past deeds. <span class="ch">不善身行</span> in this version seems more likely to translate a standard Buddhist expression like S. <em>akuśala kāya karmapatha</em> (or <em>saṃskāra</em>). As the passage continues, this difference in approach is more apparent. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n6"><em>final end</em>. C. <span class="ch">究竟</span>. It’s not clear whether this refers to the end of unskillful deeds or rebirth. AN 4.195 is more explicit that the passage is refer to the gradual extirpation of past deeds by forcing their fruition through self-punishment practices. This certainly would align with the beliefs of ascetic traditions like Jainism that believed self-mortification was necessary to escape future reincarnation. In this version, this is not spelled out to the reader, and perhaps it shouldn’t be assumed to be a subtext. The Buddha seems instead to be asserting that someone who reforms himself has done enough in this regard. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n7">C. <span class="ch">生後身覺便知：『生後身覺』，生後命覺便知：『生後命覺』</span>, P. <em>So kāyapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vediyamāno ‘kāyapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vediyāmī’ti pajānāti; jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vediyamāno ‘jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ vediyāmī’ti pajānāti.</em> Presumably, <span class="ch">後身覺</span> and <span class="ch">後命覺</span> translate expressions very similar to P. <em>kāyapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ</em> and <em>jīvitapariyantikaṁ vedanaṁ</em>. I say similar because the lit. meaning of <span class="ch">後身</span> is “a later body,” meaning one in the next life. There’s no sense of ending that we’d expect from a trans. of P. <em>pariyantika</em>. It’s possible the translator was intending <span class="ch">後</span> to be read as <span class="ch">最後</span> “last.” That makes the most sense given that the passage appears to describe <em>nirvāṇa</em> after the monk’s death, interpreted as <span class="ch">竟冷</span> “the final cooling.” I’ve therefore trans. <span class="ch">後</span> as “last” in this passage. “Later” would only make sense if <em>nirvāṇa</em> were considered a kind of afterlife. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n8"><em>With correct mindfulness and correct understanding, he abandons pursuits and does nothing.</em> C. <span class="ch">捨求無為，正念正智</span>, P. <em>upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno</em>. The expression <span class="ch">捨求無為</span> only occurs in this <em>sūtra</em> and corresponds to P. <em>upekkhaka</em>, which means being “disinterested or uninvolved” and is often rendered into English as “equanimity.” It’s possible the C. translation is an awkward attempt to translate the concept of disinterest (“abandoning pursuits and doing nothing”), but Sarvāstivāda texts habitually added synonyms to clarify passages.<br/>
The expression <span class="ch">正念正智</span> (correct mindfulness and correct understanding) occurs often in MĀ and corresponds to P. <em>sati sampajāna</em>. The G. equiv. of <em>sampajāna</em> is attested as <em>saṃprajana</em>. There were clear cases of G. <em>saṃ</em> (complete), <em>sama</em> (equal), and <em>saṃma</em> (correct) being conflated because <em>saṃma</em> was often contracted in practice. However, I find it difficult to consider this reading mistaken when even Xuanzang translates the S. expression as <span class="ch">正念正知</span>. I’ve therefore preserved the translator’s interpretation here, but I read <span class="ch">智</span> as meaning <span class="ch">知</span>. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n9">This paragraph and the next are parallel with a standard conclusion found in Pali <em>sutta</em>s in which an interlocutor praises the Buddha for having revealed the truth to them: “<em>Abhikkantaṁ, bho gotama, abhikkantaṁ, bho gotama. Seyyathāpi, bho gotama, nikkujjitaṁ vā ukkujjeyya, paṭicchannaṁ vā vivareyya, mūḷhassa vā maggaṁ ācikkheyya, andhakāre vā telapajjotaṁ dhāreyya: ‘cakkhumanto rūpāni dakkhantī’ti; evamevaṁ bhotā gotamena anekapariyāyena dhammo pakāsito. Esāhaṁ bhavantaṁ gotamaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi dhammañca bhikkhusaṅghañca. Upāsakaṁ maṁ bhavaṁ gotamo dhāretu ajjatagge pāṇupetaṁ saraṇaṁ gatan”ti.</em>”<br/>
In AN 4.195, this finale has been abbreviated away at the end after the simile of the horse trader, which occurs next in this version. However, this version departs from the Pali by depicting Vāṣpa as taking refuge three times rather than once. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n10"><em>profound awakening</em>. C. <span class="ch">甚深道</span>. I’ve adopted the alternate reading, which changes <span class="ch">隨其諸道</span> (“follows his paths”) to <span class="ch">隨甚深道</span> (“accords with the profound awakening”). <span class="ch">道</span> is ambiguous to me because of this alternate reading. The Taisho reading (<span class="ch">諸道</span>) would be a plural noun, so it would be natural to read it as “many paths,” whereas it seems more natural to read <span class="ch">道</span> as a translation of <em>bodhi</em> when modified by <span class="ch">甚深</span> (“deep, profound”).
