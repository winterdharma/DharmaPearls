1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){: #ref1} One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.
{: #p1}

2\. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “The origins of the craving for existence isn’t knowable. In the past, there was no craving for existence, but now the craving for existence has arisen, and it’s readily knowable what the cause of the craving for existence is.
