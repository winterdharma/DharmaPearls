    <td id='p1'>1. Thus I have heard:<sup id="ref1"><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> One time, the Buddha traveled to Magadha and was staying at a cave in the dense mango forest near the village of Jantu.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='t26.1.491a17'>爾時，尊者彌醯為奉侍者。 於是，尊者彌醯過夜平旦著衣，持鉢，入闍鬪村，而行乞食。 乞食已竟，往至金鞞河邊。 見地平正名好㮈林。 金鞞河水極妙、可樂。 清泉徐流冷暖、和適。 見已，歡喜便作是念： 「此地平正名好㮈林。 金鞞河水極妙、可樂。 清泉徐流冷暖、和適。 若族姓子欲學斷者，當於此處。 我亦有所斷。 寧可在此靜處學斷耶？」</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. Venerable Meghiya<sup id="ref3"><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> was serving as his attendant at the time. After the night had passed and the sun rose, Venerable Meghiya put on his robe, took his bowl into Jantu, and walked about soliciting alms. When he was finished soliciting alms, he went to the side of the *Kimba River<sup id="ref4"><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>. There, he saw the level plain of a famously beautiful mango grove. The water of the river was sublime and delightful. It was both warm and cool and flowed slowly and serenely from a clear spring. When he saw this, he rejoiced and thought, “This level plain is a famously beautiful mango grove. The water of the river is sublime and delightful. It’s both warm and cool and flows slowly and serenely from a clear spring. If a clansman wanted to work towards ending the afflictions<sup id="ref5"><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>, he could do it here. I have some to end myself. Shouldn’t I work towards ending them here in this peaceful place?”</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='t26.1.491a24'>於是，彌醯食訖中後擧衣鉢已，澡洗手足。 以尼師檀著於肩上，往詣佛所。 稽首禮足，却住一面，白曰： 「世尊，我今平旦著衣持鉢，入闍鬪村而行乞食。 乞食已竟，往至金鞞河邊。 見地平正名好㮈林。 金鞞河水極妙、可樂。 清泉徐流冷暖、和適。 我見喜已，便作是念： 『此地平正名好㮈林。 金鞞河水極妙、可樂。 清泉徐流冷暖、和適。 若族姓子欲學斷者，當於此處。 我亦有所斷。 寧可在此靜處學斷耶？』 世尊，我今欲往至彼㮈林靜處，學斷。」</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. When he finished his meal that afternoon, Meghiya picked up his robe and bowl and washed his hands and feet. He put his sitting mat over his shoulder and went back to the Buddha. He then bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to stand to one side, and said, “Bhagavān, this morning, I put on my robe, took my bowl into Jantu, and walked about soliciting alms. When I was finished soliciting alms, I went to the side of the Kimba River. There, I saw the level plain of a famously beautiful mango grove. The water of the river was sublime and delightful. It was both warm and cool and flowed slowly and serenely from a clear spring. When I saw this, I rejoiced and thought, ‘This level plain is a famously beautiful mango grove.

    <td id='p4'>4. The Bhagavān then said, “Now, Meghiya, don’t you realize? I’m alone here. There aren’t any people, and I would have no attendant. You can stay there a little while, but a monk needs to come to be my attendant. Then, you can go train at a peaceful place in that mango grove.”</td>

    <td id='p7'>7. Venerable Meghiya then had well accepted, well remembered, and well recited what the Buddha had taught. He bowed at the Buddha’s feet, circled him three times, and departed for the mango grove.

    <td id='p8'>8. While Venerable Meghiya was staying in that mango grove, he had three kinds of bad and unskillful thoughts occur to him: desirous thoughts, angry thoughts, and harmful thoughts. He remembered the Bhagavān when this happened. That afternoon, he rose from his seat of repose and returned to the Buddha. He bowed his head at his feet, withdrew to stand at one side, and said, “Bhagavān, I went to the mango grove and sat in a peaceful place, but then three kinds of bad and unskillful thoughts occurred to me: desirous thoughts, angry thoughts, and harmful thoughts.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0491a14" target="_blank">T26.1.491a14-2a12</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is a parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an9.3" target="_blank">AN 9.3</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ud4.1" target="_blank">Ud 4.1</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>Jantu</em>. C. 闍鬪村 (EMC. ʒɪă-təu = *Jatu[ṇa]). P/S. Jantu is properly G. Jaṃtu but <a href="https://gandhari.org/dictionary/ja%E1%B9%83tu" target="_blank">attested in fragments</a> as G. Jadu, Jatuṇa, and Jaduṇa. This may be a case of consonants being transposed in G. sources (Brough, 50), and the ending syllable being silent. I’ve adopted the S. equivalent. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>Meghiya</em>. C. 彌醯 (EMC. miĕhei = *Mehi), P. <em>Meghiya</em>, G. <em>Mekhiya</em>. In G., <em>gh</em> frequently becomes <em>kh</em>, but the consonants <em>g/k</em> are often weakened to fricatives or go silent. The result is that <em>-k-</em> can become <em>-y-</em> (Brough, 86), and <em>-kh-</em> can become <em>-h-</em> (Brough, 93). This scenario matches the C. transliteration (*Mehi[ya]), so I’ve adopted the S. equivalent. For a summary of Meghiya’s background, see the <a href="https://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/me_mu/meghiya.htm" target="_blank"><cite>Buddhist Dictionary of Pali Proper Names</cite></a>. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>Kimba River</em>. C. 金鞞河 (EMC. *Kiṃba River), P. <em>kimikāḷāya nadiyā</em>, G. ?. There’s no attestation for G. <em>Kiṃba</em> in G. sources yet, but S. <em>Kimba</em> is a kind of tree. I’ve adopted this as an educated guess. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>work toward ending the afflictions</em>. C. 學斷, P. <em>padhāna</em>, G. <em>prahana *vinedi</em>. Lit. “train in abandoning.” What Meghiya wants to abandon is left unsaid, but the likely candidates are things like suffering or affliction. The P. parallel, as is often the case, has “exertion” (P. <em>padhāna</em>) instead of “abandoning” (G. <em>prahana</em>). [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p>In AN 9.3, Meghiya repeats this objection three times, rather than his initial request, which makes him appear more impolite than this version. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p><em>complete</em>. C. 熟. Lit. “matured,” “ripened,” or “cooked.” None of these usages really match this context, so I’ve used a more generic English equivalent. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p><em>a good friend, being in the company of good friends, and being united with good friends</em>. C. 自善知識、與善知識倶、善知識共和合, P. <em>kalyāṇamitto hoti kalyāṇasahāyo kalyāṇasampavaṅko</em>. “Good friend” (善知識) corresponds to S. <em>kalyāṇamitra</em> (P. <em>kalyāṇamitta</em>). “In the company of” (與 … 倶) corresponds better with S. <em>sahāyana</em> or <em>sahāyatva</em>, which mean “companionship” or “association” respectively, than it does with P/S. <em>sahāya</em> (“a companion”). “In harmony with” (共和合) is also difficult to relate to P. <em>sampavaṅka</em>. 共和合 corresponds with P. <em>samagga</em> (G. <em>samagra</em>) in other parallels. To give a few examples: Aniruddha’s description of his relationship with his companions in MĀ 72/MN 128 and MĀ 185/MN 31, at the end of the summary verses of MĀ 122/AN 8.10, and Varsakāra’s questions to Ānanda in MĀ 145/MN 108.</p>
<p>Having pointed this out, however, doesn’t invalidate the Pali reading, for we can see it mirrored in other Chinese parallels such as SĀ 12.14 (914), which appears to have the same three synonyms for “friends” that we find in Theravāda <em>sutta</em>s. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n9"><p><em>Pratimokṣa.</em> C. 從解脫, P. <em>pātimokkha</em>. The Chinese translator has rendered Pratimokṣa as “Conformance with (從 = <em>prati-</em>) Liberation (解脫 = <em>-mokṣa</em>).” I’ve converted the translation back to Sanskrit for clarity. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</p></li>
