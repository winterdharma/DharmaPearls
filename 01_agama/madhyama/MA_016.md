Among the gods like Māra and Brahmā, the ascetics and priests, and beings from humans up to the gods in this world, he accomplished and dwells in his own knowledge, awakening, and direct experience. When he teaches the Dharma, it’s good in the beginning, the middle, and the end, both its meaning and content are complete and pure, and it demonstrates the religious practice.

<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0438b13" target="_blank">T26.1.438b13-9c22</a>. The only parallel that I have found for this <em>sūtra</em> is <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.65" target="_blank">AN 3.65</a>. AN 3.65 has gained a high profile in modern Buddhist discourse because it includes a passage in which the Buddhist seems to advocate for a modern style of critical inquiry. Unfortunately, this intriguing passage does not occur here in the Sarvāstivāda parallel. This passage, however, is found in two other <em>sutta</em>s (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.66" target="_blank">AN 3.66</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.193" target="_blank">4.193</a>) as a standard method of dispelling doubt. The <cite>Ekottarika Āgama</cite> of the Sarvāstivādins is lost today, but it may have contained a similar passage in parallels to these <em>sutta</em>s.</p>
<p>There is scant little evidence of other versions that may have existed. I’ve only found a passage reference to a <em>Kālāma Sūtra</em> by Asaṅga in his <cite>Yogācārabhūmi</cite> translated by Xuanzang (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T30n1579_p0570a13" target="_blank">T1579.30.570a13</a>). No information is provided about it by Asaṅga, but a Chinese commentator on the passage indicates that “Kālāma” referred to both a country and a people (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/A120n1561_p0576b06">A1561.120.576b6</a>). Otherwise, the majority of references to the name Kālāma relate to the non-Buddhist teacher Ārāḍa Kālāma.</p>
<p>Comparing this <em>sūtra</em> with AN 3.65, the main differences are found in the introduction. In this version, there is a standard introduction that depicts the people of *Keśaputra had heard that the Buddha had arrived and decide to go visit him. Once they do, they ask him how to resolve their doubts about various religious teachers who contradict and criticize each other. Here, the Buddha tells them that their doubts are because they lack “pure knowledge” (presumably, accurate knowledge) about the afterlife and what constitutes good and bad conduct. This brief statement serves as the equivalent of the Buddha’s list of sources of information that cannot be fully trusted.</p>
<p>The remainder of the two <em>sūtra</em>s follow the same basic outline with differences in details. AN 3.65, however, takes up a number of positive qualities juxtaposed against the three roots of unskillfulness, while this <em>sūtra</em> moves on to a standard statement of the ten good deeds. After this, the Buddha teaches the Kālāmas about the four immeasurables and four peaceful dwellings. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>country of the Kālāmas</em>. C. <span class="ch">伽藍</span> (EMC k’ie-lam = Pr. <em>kalām[a]</em>?), P/S. Kālāma. The Taisho reads <span class="ch">園</span> (“park”), which appears to be an error. I’ve adopted an alternate reading of <span class="ch">國</span> (“country”).</p>
<p><em>*Keśaputra</em>. C. <span class="ch">羇舍子</span> (EMC kɪĕ-ʃɪă + <em>putra</em> = Pr. <em>keśaputra</em>?), P. <em>kesamutta</em>. The Chinese is a partial transliteration (<span class="ch">子</span> typically translates P. <em>putta</em>, S. <em>putra</em>). I’ve not located a S. attestation for this place name, so I’ve tentatively reconstructed it according to the the Chinese transliteration.</p>
<p><em>rosewood grove.</em> C. 尸攝惒林 (EMC. ʃɪi-ʃɪɛp-ɦua + “forest” = G. <em>śiśapavana</em>), P. <em>siṃsapā</em>, S. <em>śiṃśapā</em>. AN 3.65 does not mention this grove. An oddity about MĀ is that in all five <em>sūtra</em>s that mention rosewood groves call them “northern” groves. It seems quite a coincidence that all of these groves are “to the north” of a village or mountain. I wonder if north was not part of the tree’s name, i.e. “the Northern Rosewood Tree.” But when the Kālāmas go to the grove, they walk north to reach it. It seems to simply be a repeated feature of MĀ’s introductions. In any case, this was the classical name for the Indian rosewood tree (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalbergia_sissoo" target="_blank">Dalbergia sissoo</a></em>), which today is called the <em>shisham</em> tree in India.

<li id="n3"><p>This introduction is very similar to the standard introductions explaining how townsfolk come to ask the Buddha questions in the <cite>Dīgha Nikāya</cite>, <cite>Aṅguttara Nikāya</cite>, and <cite>Dīrgha Āgama</cite>. It occurs frequently in the <cite>Majjhima Nikāya</cite> but only a few times here in the <cite>Madhyama Āgama</cite>. It seems to be a feature of narrative development in EBTs and might indicate later editing or composition given how long and standardized it became. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>You’ll become hesitant … which deeds are blameworthy and which are blameless</em>. This same answer is given to Pāṭaliya in MĀ 20. There’s also a similar passage in MĀ 19 where the Buddha recounts a conversation with a Jain in which he tells the non-Buddhist that he lacks pure knowledge regarding the nature of self. The expression seems to mean knowledge pure of error. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>pre-existing causes</em>. C. <span class="ch">因習本有</span>. I suspect that <span class="ch">因習</span> translates a verb equivalent to P. <em>uppajjati</em> (“to arise, come into being”), which is found in the P. parallel. This is also supported vaguely by an alternate reading in MĀ 111 that changes <span class="ch">因習</span> to <span class="ch">因集</span>, suggesting that the intended reading was similar to S. <em>samudaya</em>. Chinese Buddhists vacillated between <span class="ch">集</span> and <span class="ch">習</span> as translations of <em>samudaya</em> in the Āgamas. <span class="ch">本有</span> would normally be read as “original” or “past existence.” This would make the expression <span class="ch">三因習本有</span> mean “three causes of past existence” or perhaps “three pre-existing causes.” As we shall see, this refers to the three unskillful roots, so I’ve opted for the latter rendering. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p>This presentation of the path of ten good deeds is identical to the first seven precepts found in the longer list of precepts followed by an ascetic (e.g., in <a href="MA_080.html#the-twenty-renunciations" target="_blank">MĀ 80</a>). To these seven precepts, three more are added to cover mental good deeds of not longing for possessions, not being hateful, and having right view. While the Buddha is speaking to laypeople here, the precepts are those of a monk. Thus, they are stricter than would have been expected of laypeople. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p>This final count of characters is very close. I count a total of 1,988 characters in the Taisho edition. Looking at the variant readings, I don’t see any obvious cases that would subtract the characters needed to reach 1,987. Perhaps an extra character has slipped in without causing discrepancies between the official canonical editions. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
