    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Among the ways of living, the practice of soliciting alms is the extreme of lowliness.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> The world shuns it so much, calling it the practice of shaving one’s head and holding out a bowl. There’s a reason that those clansmen have taken it up. Why is that? ‘Because I’m tired of birth, old age, illness, death, grief, lamentation, sorrow, pain, and trouble, or simply being subject to the extreme of this whole mass of suffering.’ Didn’t all of you leave home to train on the path with such a thought?”</td>

The Bhagavān also told the monks, “Foolish are the people who leave home to train on the path with this thought but whose practice then is seriously affected by attachments and longing. Their minds are wrapped in filth, being spiteful, unfaithful, slothful, forgetful, and lacking right <em>samādhi</em>. They have poor wisdom, deranged thoughts, and disturbed faculties.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1">For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0647a15" target="_blank">T26.1.647a15-b17</a>. It’s directly parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/iti91" target="_blank">Iti 91</a> and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T17n0765_p0682a20" target="_blank">T765.II.32</a> (a <cite>Itivṛttaka</cite> parallel trans. by Xuanzang). It also shares some parallel material with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.80" target="_blank">SN 22.80</a> and <a href="../samyukta/01/SA1_55.html" target="_blank">SĀ 1.55</a> as well.<br/>
The partial parallels in SN and SĀ include background stories about what led the Buddha to give the sermon about the goal of the ascetic life. The <cite>Itivuttaka</cite> version found its way into the <cite>Madhyama Āgama</cite>. Such brief <em>sūtra</em>s as this one do not ostensibly belong among the middle length discourses, and their inclusion is largely the reason MĀ contains 70 more individual <em>sūtra</em>s than MN does today (222 vs. 152). About 60 <em>sūtra</em>s in MĀ are less than a page of Taisho in length, and 35 are not more than half a page. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n2"><em>Among the ways of living, the practice of soliciting alms is the extreme of lowliness.</em> C. <span class="ch">於生活中，下極至邊，謂行乞食</span>, P. <em>antamidaṁ, bhikkhave, jīvikānaṁ yadidaṁ piṇḍolyaṁ</em>. The C. expression <span class="ch">至邊</span> (“reach the extreme”) appears to trans. an equiv. of P. <em>antamida</em>, which can mean “an extreme, end, limit, lowest.” I’ve translated the C. accordingly since <span class="ch">邊</span> has a similar range of meanings as <em>anta</em>. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n3"><em>someone who washes off ink stains with ink, removes blood with blood, removes dirt with dirt, or removes a feces with feces.</em> C. <span class="ch">猶人以墨浣墨所污，以血除血，以垢除垢，以濁除濁，以廁除廁</span>. This analogy doesn’t occur in SN 22.80 or Iti 91. However, we can find similar expressions in Pali sources, such as <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn3.21" target="_blank">SN 3.21</a>: “This person is like someone who goes from darkness to darkness, from blackness to blackness, from bloodstain to bloodstain.” (“<em>Seyyathāpi, mahārāja, puriso andhakārā vā andhakāraṁ gaccheyya, tamā vā tamaṁ gaccheyya, lohitamalā vā lohitamalaṁ gaccheyya.</em>”)<br/>
It would seem that, as is often the case, the Sarvāstivādins have expanded this analogy and changed it in some ways. The parallel passage in SĀ 1.55 reads more like SN 3.21: “Such a man is like someone who goes into gloom from gloom or into darkness from darkness, who gets out of a latrine and falls back into a latrine, who washes blood off with blood, or who abandons doing evils only to take up those evils again” (<span class="ch">譬如士夫從闇而入闇，從冥入冥，從糞廁出復墮糞廁，以血洗血，捨離諸惡還復取惡</span>).<br/>
As a side note, the phrase <span class="ch">以廁除廁</span> lit. means “removes a latrine with a latrine.” I’ve translated 廁 as “feces” here assuming the intent is still to list types of stains. In SĀ 1.55, the latrine reading makes better sense because it was translated as a person falling into it. I’ve also translated <span class="ch">墨</span> as “ink” but it could simply mean “black.” [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</li>
<li id="n4"><em>leftover wood from a cremation in a remote place.</em> C. <span class="ch">無事處燒人殘木</span>. The proper reading of this expression isn’t entirely clear, but apparently it is a noun <span class="ch">殘木</span> (“leftover wood”) with two modifiers: <span class="ch">無事處</span> (“remote place”) and <span class="ch">燒人</span> (“cremated person”). I’ve translated the last as “a cremation.” <span class="ch">無事處</span> lit. means “place without business.” It was a way of trans. P. <em>ārañña</em>, which was sometimes interpreted as “without conflict” or “secluded” as well as “forest.” It refers to living in an uninhabited wilderness as a recluse to focus on contemplative practice. In the context of this <em>sūtra</em>, which juxtaposes it with a village, I’ve translated 無事 as “remote.” The basic meaning was a peaceful place away from other people.<br/>
The parallels confirm that this analogy was confusing in its original language because they disagree in their individual wordings. SN 22.80 and Iti 91 both read: “Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness”  (<em>seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, chavālātaṁ ubhatopadittaṁ majjhe gūthagataṁ, neva gāme kaṭṭhatthaṁ pharati, nāraññe kaṭṭhatthaṁ pharati</em>). This includes a funeral pyre in the imagery, but here in MĀ 140 the useless wood is leftovers from the fire rather than a stick used to light it.<br/>
SĀ 1.55 uses a similar image of leftover wood from a cremation, but the whole passage is another variation on the theme: “He is also like a burned stick from a cremation that’s discarded on a charnel ground and can’t be included in kindling wood” (<span class="ch">又復譬如焚尸火𣕊捐棄塜間，不為樵伐之所採拾</span>).
