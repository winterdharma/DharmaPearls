<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0421a12" target="_blank">T26.1.421a12-2a17</a>. The correct reading of this <em>sūtra</em>’s title would appear to be “Skillful Qualities” given the occurrence of <span class="ch">善法</span> in <a href="MA_095.html" target="_blank">MĀ 95</a>, which has a list of skillful qualities as its subject. Here, we have another such list of skillful qualities that make one a competent renunciate.</p>
<p>Direct parallels to this <em>sūtra</em> include <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an7.68" target="_blank">AN 7.68</a>, EĀ 39.1, T27, and a quotation in the <em>Abhidharma Saṃgītiparyāya</em> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1536_p0437b18" target="_blank">T1536.26.437b18-c10</a>). [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>This is the traditional list of twelve (sometimes nine) types of <em>sūtra</em>s found in Indian Buddhist sources. Deciphering the precise order of this list is a challenge because Saṃghadeva translates all but one item (<em>gāthā</em>), and the order of these lists varied from source to source. Using the traditional S. interpretations of <em>itivṛttaka</em>, <em>vyākaraṇa</em>, and <em>udāna</em> as clues, I arrive at this list: S. <em>sūtra</em>, <em>geya</em>, <em>vyākaraṇa</em>, <em>gāthā</em>, <em>nidāna</em>, <em>itivṛttaka</em>, <em>avadāna</em>, <em>udāna</em>, <em>jātaka</em>, <em>vaipulya</em>, <em>adbhuta-dharma</em>, and <em>upadeśa</em>. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p>This passage is cryptic. A parallel passage in Xuanzang’s translation of the <em>Abhidharma Saṃgītiparyāya</em> (T1536.437b24-26) reads: “This is a time he should cultivate calm appearances … active appearances … indifferent appearances” (<span class="ch">謂此時應修止相⋯舉相⋯捨相等</span>). This seems to refer to a monk’s disposition or daily activities. I’ve translated the passage here in terms of social position. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>relieving himself</em>. C. <span class="ch">大小便</span>. The Chinese expression is a euphemism for defecating and urinating. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>warriors … priests … householders … ascetics</em>. S. <em>kṣatriya</em>, <em>brāhmaṇa</em>, <em>gṛhapati</em>, and <em>śramaṇa</em>. The warriors were in later eras the nobility of India, being the heads of government and the military. Householders were well-to-do and influential people due to wealth like today’s urban middle class, but they weren’t part of the nobility or priesthood. Ascetics were spiritual practitioners and leaders who had left secular life, taken vows of poverty, and adopted a nomadic life. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
