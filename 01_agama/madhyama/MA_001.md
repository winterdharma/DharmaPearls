<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>The present text was a re-translation of a version of the <cite>Madhyama Āgama</cite> that had been translated to Chinese by Dao-an’s Chang’an team around 385 CE. This new translation was completed in 398 and released in 402 by a team that worked at a <em>vihāra</em> in modern Nanjing.</p>
<p>The intervening years had seen a significant amount of warfare and political chaos that resulted from the defeat of Fu Jian’s attempt to conquer southern China. His empire in northern China subsequently broke up into smaller states, while the south remained under the control of the Eastern Jin dynasty. Dao-an’s translation team had worked under Fu Jian’s auspices and found themselves in the middle of the fighting when Chang’an fell shortly after their translation of the <cite>Ekottarika Āgama</cite> was complete.</p>
<p>While Dao-an perished, several members of his team escaped to continue their translation work. One of them was Gautama Saṅghadeva who joined the translation project in Nanjing to produce a second translation of the <cite>Medium Discourses</cite>.</p>
<p>The political chaos continued, however, and their work was interrupted in 399 by a destructive rebellion that took several years to resolve. This resulted in a delayed release of their new translation in 402. Despite these difficulties, the new translation was well-edited and has been well-preserved, unlike the unfortunate situation that we have with other Āgama translations from the same period. The first translation of the <cite>Madhyama Āgama</cite> was apparently poorly edited and/or maintained. As a result, this new translation supplanted it, and it eventually disappeared. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0421a12" target="_blank">T26.1.421a12-2a17</a>. The correct reading of this <em>sūtra</em>’s title would appear to be “Skillful Qualities” given the occurrence of <span class="ch">善法</span> in <a href="MA_095.html" target="_blank">MĀ 95</a>, which has a list of skillful qualities as its subject. Here, we have another such list of skillful qualities that make one a competent renunciate.</p>
<p>Direct parallels to this <em>sūtra</em> include <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an7.68" target="_blank">AN 7.68</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ea39.1" target="_blank">EĀ 39.1</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/T27" target="_blank">T27</a>, and a passage in the Mahāyāna <cite>Parinirvāṇa Sūtra</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T12n0374_p0451b13" target="_blank">T374</a> and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T12n0375_p0693b14" target="_blank">T375</a>). The same list of seven things a monk should know is also found in a variety of sources, such as <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0006_p0176c20" target="_blank">T6</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0013_p0236c23" target="_blank">T13</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn33#2.3.14" target="_blank">DN 33</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T24n1451_p0383c12" target="_blank">T1451</a>, and in the <em>Abhidharma Saṃgītiparyāya</em> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T26n1536_p0437b18" target="_blank">T1536.26.437b18-c10</a>).</p>
<p>The consistency of the list, which is virtually the same in meaning and order across these various parallels, indicates that it was an important pre-sectarian teaching. However, the interpretation of the list items varies between sectarian traditions, indicating that the explanations were recorded later. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p>This is the traditional list of twelve (sometimes nine) types of <em>sūtra</em>s found in Indian Buddhist sources. Deciphering the precise order of this list is a challenge because Saṃghadeva translates all but one item (<em>gāthā</em>), and the order of these lists varied from source to source. Using the traditional S. interpretations of <em>itivṛttaka</em>, <em>vyākaraṇa</em>, and <em>udāna</em> as clues, I arrive at this list: S. <em>sūtra</em>, <em>geya</em>, <em>vyākaraṇa</em>, <em>gāthā</em>, <em>nidāna</em>, <em>itivṛttaka</em>, <em>avadāna</em>, <em>udāna</em>, <em>jātaka</em>, <em>vaipulya</em>, <em>adbhuta-dharma</em>, and <em>upadeśa</em>.</p>
<p>I had previously translated <em>vyākaraṇa</em> as “assurances” because there is a strong bias toward reading this term as a prediction given by the Buddha about a disciple’s future births or awakening in later Buddhist literature. In Sanskrit, <em>vyākaraṇa</em> has this meaning, but it also can mean “detailed explanation” or “analysis.” Since the last time I reviewed this translation, I’ve seen definitions of <em>vyākaraṇa</em> from early Buddhist perspectives that interpret <em>vyākaraṇa sūtra</em>s as those in which the Buddha gave a particular disciple a teaching about a subject or his disciples gave their own analysis of a subject. I’ve therefore decided to adopt “explanations” as a better English translation.</p>
<p>This is also the only version of this list that characterizes it with S. <em>samyak</em> (<span class="ch">正</span>). I assume it means “correct” in the sense that they are authentic teachings that descend from the Buddha and First Council. I’ve chosen “proper” as a translation here.

<li id="n4"><p>This passage is cryptic. A parallel passage in Xuanzang’s translation of the <em>Abhidharma Saṃgītiparyāya</em> (T1536.437b24-26) reads: “This is a time he should cultivate calm appearances … active appearances … indifferent appearances” (<span class="ch">謂此時應修止相⋯舉相⋯捨相等</span>). This seems to refer to a monk’s disposition or daily activities. I’ve translated the passage here in terms of social position, as the terms used are <span class="ch">下</span> (“lowly”), <span class="ch">高</span> (“eminent”), and <span class="ch">捨</span> (“detached”). [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>relieving himself</em>. C. <span class="ch">大小便</span>. This Chinese expression is a euphemism for defecating and urinating. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p><em>warriors … brahmins … householders … ascetics</em>. S. <em>kṣatriya</em>, <em>brāhmaṇa</em>, <em>gṛhapati</em>, and <em>śramaṇa</em>. The warriors were in later eras the nobility of India, being the heads of government and the military. Householders were influential people due to their wealth like today’s urban middle class, but they weren’t part of the nobility or priesthood. Ascetics were spiritual practitioners and leaders who had left secular life, taken vows of poverty, and adopted a nomadic life.</p>
<p>Brahmins often served as administrators and priests in ancient India. Later in history, they more closely resembled a class of people defined by their profession, but originally they were a distinct ethnic group or tribe. Class and tribal identities blurred together in Indian civilization because of the practice of assigning tribes to particular professions. I don’t translate S. <em>brāhmaṇa</em> to “priest” anymore because they were not always priests, but they did hold a high social standing regardless of their profession.

<li id="n7"><p>While AN 7.68 lacks this conclusion, a very similar passage about the superiority of the person who benefits themselves and others is found in AN 4.95. The metaphor that likens the best to ghee is also used to praise other types of people in <em>sutta</em>s like DN 9, SN 34.1-2 and 34.55, as well as AN 5.181, 5.190, and 10.91. Thus, we can see that it was a fairly well known type of praise, which is also found in the conclusions of EĀ 39.1 and T27. The Mahāyāna <cite>Parinirvāṇa Sūtra</cite> version instead likens the best person to a wishing jewel. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p>The <cite>Madhyama Āgama</cite> translation is unique (to my knowledge) in using these ending character counts as a method of copyist error detection. My count of the received Taisho text for this <em>sūtra</em> is 1,424 characters. This total would come down to 1,423 characters if we adopt the alternate reading in paragraph 3 that deletes a superfluous <span class="ch">是</span>. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
