<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0422c09" target="_blank">T26.1.422c9-4a12</a>. Parallels include <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an7.67" target="_blank">AN 7.67</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ea39.4" target="_blank">EĀ 39.4</a>.</p>
<p>This <em>sūtra</em> is a close parallel to AN 7.67. The main difference being that it presents the metaphor of the frontier city and skillful qualities of the noble disciple in two separate lists, then states the metaphors in a third section. AN 7.67 only presents the frontier city and the metaphors in two sections. The result is that this version is somewhat longer.</p> 
<p>When we turn to EĀ 39.4, we find that it has the same outline as AN 7.67 consisting of a description of a frontier city and then the metaphors involving a noble disciple. But it contains a simpler parable that consists of only a single seven-item list. The primary difference is that the four meditations in that simpler version haven’t been extracted and placed in a second list. The individual items in both the description of the frontier city’s provisions and the religious practice vary somewhat as well, but they have the same overall meaning.</p>
<p>On the whole, the paradigm of practice outlined in this <em>sūtra</em> and AN 7.67 presents a path akin to the eightfold path, which culminates in <em>samādhi</em>. In EĀ 39.4, the outline would appear to instead follow that of the gradual path, which culminates in wisdom. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>a king’s frontier city is supplied with seven things and an abundance of four foods … only by internal self-destruction.</em>. C. <span class="ch">王邊城七事具足，四食豐饒、易、不難得。是故，王城不為外敵破；唯除内自壞。</span>, P.  <em>rañño paccantimaṁ nagaraṁ sattahi nagaraparikkhārehi suparikkhataṁ hoti, catunnañca āhārānaṁ nikāmalābhī hoti akicchalābhī akasiralābhī. Idaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, rañño paccantimaṁ nagaraṁ akaraṇīyaṁ bāhirehi paccatthikehi paccāmittehi.</em>.</p>
<p>This refrain will be repeated throughout. This version has added the proviso that the city could be defeated by “internal self-destruction” (<span class="ch">内自壞</span>). AN 7.67 instead adds a synonym for “enemies” (<em>paccāmittehi</em>). [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>The king’s frontier city erects a guard tower, building it on ground that makes it sturdy and indestructible.</em>. C. <span class="ch">王邊城造立樓櫓，築地使堅、不可毀壞</span>, P.  <em>Idha, bhikkhave, rañño paccantime nagare esikā hoti gambhīranemā sunikhātā acalā asampavedhī</em>. C. <span class="ch">樓櫓</span> in native Chinese literature referred to both defensive watch towers placed next to city gates as well as mobile seige turrets used to defeat city walls in warfare. Here, it seems to refer to a central tower installed to defend a small outpost or fortified town.</p> 
<p>However, when we turn to the P. parallel, it refers to a pillar placed to support a city gate (<em>esikā</em>). This was to make the gate sturdy and difficult to knock down. EĀ 39.4, too, includes the city having “gates that are sturdy” (<span class="ch">門戶牢固</span>) as it’s second item. It’s probably best then to surmise that the tower here in MĀ 3 refers to a guard tower defending the city’s gates.</p>
<p><em>Those inside the city are kept safe, and external enemies are kept at bay. This is called the first thing with which the king’s city is supplied.</em> C. <span class="ch">為内安隱，制外怨敵。是謂王城一事具足</span>, P. <em>iminā paṭhamena nagaraparikkhārena suparikkhataṁ hoti rañño paccantimaṁ nagaraṁ abbhantarānaṁ guttiyā bāhirānaṁ paṭighātāya</em>. This version is again very similar to AN 7.67. The first sentence lit. means “those inside are made safe” (<span class="ch">為内安隱</span>) and “external enemies are controlled” (<span class="ch">制外怨敵</span>), where AN 7.67 has verbs meaning “guarded” (<em>guttiyā</em>) and “kept at bay” (<em>paṭighātāya</em>). This conclusion will also be a repeated refrain. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>suppose the king’s city digs a moat, making it quite deep and wide, and it’s maintained dependably.</em>. C. <span class="ch">如王邊城掘鑿池塹，極使深廣，修備可依</span>, P. <em>rañño paccantime nagare parikkhā hoti gambhīrā ceva vitthatā ca</em>. Here we see the expanded descriptions that have been added to MĀ 3 compared to AN 7.67. The P. parallel simply says the city “has a moat that is deep and wide” (<em>parikkhā hoti gambhīrā ceva vitthatā ca</em>), but here MĀ 3 adds that it’s maintained well. The C. <span class="ch">池塹</span> also makes clear that it is in fact a water-filled moat, and not just a ditch or trench. EĀ 39.4’s third item reads the same as AN 7.67 does here. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>suppose the king’s frontier city makes a path all around it that’s cleared, level, and broad.</em>. C. <span class="ch">如王邊城周匝通道，開除、平、博</span>, P. <em>rañño paccantime nagare anupariyāyapatho hoti ucco ceva vitthato ca</em>. C. <span class="ch">周匝通道</span> is equivalent to P. <em>anupariyāyapatha</em>, which both mean an encircling or perimeter road. However, the descriptions only agree that it’s wide. P. says that it’s also elevated (<em>ucca</em>), but MĀ 3 says that it is cleared (<span class="ch">開除</span>) and level (<span class="ch">平</span>). <span class="ch">開除</span>, lit. means “opened and removed,” which presumably refers to removing obstructing brush and trees. This item is not included in EĀ 39.4’s parable. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p><em>suppose the king’s frontier city gathers a fourfold army of elephant troops, horse troops, chariot troops, and foot troops.</em>. C. <span class="ch">如王邊城集四種軍力：象軍、馬軍、車軍、歩軍</span>, P.  <em>rañño paccantime nagare bahubalakāyo paṭivasati, seyyathidaṁ—hatthārohā assārohā rathikā dhanuggahā celakā calakā piṇḍadāyakā uggā rājaputtā pakkhandino mahānāgā sūrā cammayodhino dāsakaputtā</em>. In this case, AN 7.67 has been expanded quite a bit more than MĀ 3 by adding many more examples of manpower for a garrison than the standard four types of troops. This expanded description of armed forces is also found in DN 2, whereas in MĀ and SĀ the four types of troops are a standard pericope. This item is not included in EĀ 39.4’s parable. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p><em>suppose the king’s frontier city prepares armaments, such as bows, arrows, spears, and pikes.</em>. C. <span class="ch">如王邊城豫備軍器，弓、矢、鉾、戟</span>, P.  <em>rañño paccantime nagare bahuṁ āvudhaṁ sannicitaṁ hoti salākañceva jevanikañca</em>. Here, both versions essentially agree, with MĀ 3 being a bit more specific. This is the sixth item in EĀ 39.4, where it simply mention the stockpiling of weapons and implements of war. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p><em>suppose the king’s frontier city appoints a commander to guard its entrances who is resourceful, intelligent, courageous, and shrewd. He permits those who are good to enter and bars those who are not good.</em>. C. <span class="ch">如王邊城立守門大將明略、智辯、勇毅、奇謀。善則聽入；不善則禁</span>, P. <em>rañño paccantime nagare dovāriko hoti paṇḍito byatto medhāvī aññātānaṁ nivāretā ñātānaṁ pavesetā</em>.</p>
<p>Here, MA 3 essentially agrees with AN 7.67, though there is again a difference at the end of these two descriptions. MĀ 3 says the commander keeps out bad people, while AN 7.67 says he keeps out strangers. This item is similar to the seventh item in EĀ 39.4, but there it refers to the lord of the entire city who punishes those who deserve punishment and governs those who are governable. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n9"><p><em>suppose the king’s frontier city builds a high wall, making it quite sturdy and coating it with whitewash.</em> C. <span class="ch">如王邊城築立高墻，令極牢固，泥塗堊灑</span>, P. <em>rañño paccantime nagare pākāro hoti ucco ceva vitthato ca vāsanalepanasampanno ca</em>.</p>
<p>Here, the P. parallel says that the walls are high (<em>ucca</em>), wide (<em>vitthata</em>), and completely covered with plaster (<em>vāsanalepanasampanna</em>). <span class="ch">堊灑</span> is not entirely clear as to what exactly it means here, but <span class="ch">堊</span> usu. meant a coating of a light colored mud or plaster, and <span class="ch">灑</span> meant to soak or coat. Thus, I’ve rendered it as “whitewash,” but it probably translated an equiv. of P. <em>vāsanalepana</em>. This item doesn’t occur in EĀ 39.4’s parable. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n10"><p><em>The king’s frontier city is provided with a reserve of water, hay, and firewood. Those inside the city are kept safe, and external enemies are kept at bay. This is called the first food that’s abundant in the king’s city, which is easy and not difficult to obtain.</em> C. <span class="ch">王邊城水、草、樵木資有豫備。為内安隱，制外怨敵。是謂王城一食豐饒、易、不難得</span>, P. <em>rañño paccantime nagare bahuṁ tiṇakaṭṭhodakaṁ sannicitaṁ hoti abbhantarānaṁ ratiyā aparitassāya phāsuvihārāya bāhirānaṁ paṭighātāya</em>.</p>
<p>Both MĀ 3 and AN 7.67 agree that this first type of food is a good supply of wood, hay, and water. The P. parallel, however, has a more concise conclusion that says this was for the “enjoyment (<em>ratiyā</em>), relief (<em>aparitassāya</em>), and comfort (<em>phāsuvihārāya</em>) of those within” as well as to keep outside enemies at bay. MĀ 3 keeps the same conclusion as it had for the first list of seven features while repeating the refrain for this list of four foods. This is the fifth item in EĀ 39.4’s parable, which mentions only wood and hay. [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n11"><p><em>the king’s frontier city harvests much rice and stockpiles barley.</em> C. <span class="ch">如王邊城多收稻穀及儲畜麥</span>, P. <em>rañño paccantime nagare bahuṁ sāliyavakaṁ sannicitaṁ hoti</em>.</p>
<p>Both MĀ 3 and AN 7.67 agree on this second type of food. It corresponds to the fourth item in EĀ 39.4’s parable, which mentions only that the granaries of the city are full. [<a href="#ref11">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n12"><p><em>the king’s frontier city stockpiles calabash beans, green grams, and lentils.</em> C. <span class="ch">如王邊城多積秥豆及大、小豆</span>, P. <em>rañño paccantime nagare bahuṁ tilamuggamāsāparaṇṇaṁ sannicitaṁ hoti</em>.</p>
<p>My translation here of <span class="ch">秥豆及大、小豆</span> is an educated guess based on glosses found in classical Chinese Buddhist dictionaries and patterns of translation in other texts. Essentially, it appears to be a list of two or three common Indian legumes, but it’s difficult to know which specifically were intended here from the terms <span class="ch">大豆</span> and <span class="ch">小豆</span>, which lit. mean “large bean” and “small bean.” Regardless, though, this passage is in general agreement with AN 7.67, which mentions sesame, green gram, beans, and vegetables (<em>tila-mugga-māsā-aparaṇṇa</em>). This item isn’t found in EĀ 39.4. [<a href="#ref12">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n13"><p><em>the king’s frontier city has stores of butter, oil, honey, sugarcane, sugar, fish, sea salt, and dried meat, all of which are fully supplied.</em> C. <span class="ch">如王邊城畜酥、油、蜜、及甘、蔗餹、魚鹽、脯肉，一切具足</span>, P. <em>rañño paccantime nagare bahuṁ bhesajjaṁ sannicitaṁ hoti, seyyathidaṁ—sappi navanītaṁ telaṁ madhu phāṇitaṁ loṇaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>This list is fairly clearcut in Chinese. <span class="ch">蔗餹</span> likely is synonymous with <span class="ch">蔗糖</span>, meaning sugar refined from sugarcane juice. AN 7.67 has a very similar list: ghee, butter, oil, honey, sugar, and salt (<em>sappi navanītaṁ telaṁ madhu phāṇitaṁ loṇaṁ</em>). This item isn’t found in EĀ 39.4. [<a href="#ref13">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n14"><p>AN 7.67 and EĀ 39.4 both consist of only two parts: The first part presents the concrete parable of the frontier city. The second part then presents the Dharma corollaries to each item in that metaphor that describe a noble disciple’s practice. Here, MĀ 3 is more verbose: First, it presents the concrete parable. Second, it presents the Dharma corollaries to that parable. Then, a third part explicitly relates those corollaries to the concrete metaphor. We can safely assume, I think, that this second part has been inserted by Sarvāstivādins for the sake of repetition, perhaps to aid memorization. There is no additional information added otherwise. [<a href="#ref14">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n15"><p><em>the noble disciple attains a firm faith that’s deeply attached to the Tathāgata. Once he has established the faculty of faith, he will never follow other ascetics and priests, nor gods, Māra, Brahmā, or any other worldly being.</em>. C. <span class="ch">聖弟子得堅固信，深著如來。 信根已立，終不隨外沙門梵志，若天、魔、梵、及餘世間</span>, P. <em>ariyasāvako saddho hoti, saddahati tathāgatassa bodhiṁ ‘itipi so …pe… buddho bhagavā’ti</em>.</p>
<p>While this item, faith or belief (<span class="ch">信</span>, <em>saddha</em>), is the same in both AN 7.67 and here, the definitions are different. The P. parallel depicts the disciple saying: “That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.” In AN 7.67, this standard passage has been abbreviated.</p>
<p>This first item is not found in EĀ 39.4. It begins instead with the disciple accomplishing the precepts and <em>vinaya</em>. [<a href="#ref15">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n16"><p><em>the noble disciple always acts with conscience. Being conscientious, he knows the shame of bad and unskillful qualities, defilements, and afflictions, which bring bad consequences and create the basis of birth and death.</em>. C. <span class="ch">聖弟子常行慚耻。可慚，知慚惡、不善法、穢汙、煩惱，受諸惡報，造生死本</span>, P. <em>ariyasāvako hirīmā hoti, hirīyati kāyaduccaritena vacīduccaritena manoduccaritena, hirīyati pāpakānaṁ akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ samāpattiyā</em>.</p>
<p>Again, while this is the same item as in AN 7.67, conscience (<span class="ch">慚耻</span>, <em>hirīmā</em>), the definition here is different than the Pali parallel, which reads: “a noble disciple has a conscience. They’re conscientious about bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any bad, unskillful qualities.”</p>
<p>It should be noted that the C. translation of <em>hiri</em> (<span class="ch">慚耻</span>) and <em>otappa</em> (<span class="ch">羞愧</span>) are both synonyms meaning “shame” or “embarrassment.” They reflect a fairly literal reading of the Indic words. I’ve translated them with the same nuance that they are typically given in Buddhist commentary, where one represents a person’s internal sense of right and wrong, and the second represents an awareness of social expectations.</p>
<p>This item is not found in EĀ 39.4. The second item there is guarding the faculties against violating precepts or becoming distracted. [<a href="#ref16">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n17"><p><em>the noble disciple always conducts himself with modesty. Being modest, he knows the embarrassment of bad and unskillful qualities, defilements, and afflictions, which bring bad consequences and create the basis of birth and death.</em>. C. <span class="ch">聖弟子常行羞愧。可愧，知愧惡、不善法、穢汙、煩惱，受諸惡報，造生死本</span>, P. <em>ariyasāvako ottappī hoti, ottappati kāyaduccaritena vacīduccaritena manoduccaritena, ottappati pāpakānaṁ akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ samāpattiyā</em>.</p>
<p>This is the same definition as we saw for the last item. Conscience and modesty are typically presented together as a pair, but here they’ve been separated, presumably to help fill out the list of seven skillful qualities.</p>
<p>This item is not found in EĀ 39.4. [<a href="#ref17">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n18"><p><em>the noble disciple always conducts himself with energy. He stops what’s bad and unskillful and cultivates skillful qualities. He constantly motivates himself to be focused and resolute, making roots of goodness and not abandoning the effort.</em>. C. <span class="ch">聖弟子常行精進。 斷惡、不善，修諸善法。 恒自起意專一、堅固，為諸善本不捨方便</span>, P. <em>ariyasāvako āraddhavīriyo viharati akusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ pahānāya, kusalānaṁ dhammānaṁ upasampadāya, thāmavā daḷhaparakkamo anikkhittadhuro kusalesu dhammesu</em>.</p>
<p>This is the fifth skillful quality in AN 7.67, where this and the next quality are reversed in order compared to here. The definition here is a little different from AN 7.67, but both clearly refer to the four right efforts of stopping bad qualities and cultivating good ones.</p>
<p>This item is not found in EĀ 39.4. [<a href="#ref18">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n19"><p><em>the noble disciple learns widely and is well-versed. He retains, doesn’t forget, and accumulates extensive learning about the Dharma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. Its meaning and its expression fully and purely present the religious practice. He learns widely and is well-versed in such things. He recites them up to a thousand times, investigates them in his mind, and deeply penetrates them with clear vision.</em>. C. <span class="ch">聖弟子廣學，多聞。守持、不忘、積聚博聞所謂法者，初善、中善、竟亦善。有義、有文具足，清淨，顯現梵行。如是諸法廣學，多聞。翫習至千，意所惟觀，明見深達</span>, P. <em>ariyasāvako bahussuto hoti …pe… diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdhā</em>.</p>
<p>This is the fourth good quality in AN 7.67. In the Pali, the standard passage describing the Dhamma is abbreviated, but the full passage is found in DN 33: “… a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically” (<em>bhikkhu bahussuto hoti sutadharo sutasannicayo. Ye te dhammā ādikalyāṇā majjhekalyāṇā pariyosānakalyāṇā sātthā sabyañjanā kevalaparipuṇṇaṁ parisuddhaṁ brahmacariyaṁ abhivadanti, tathārūpāssa dhammā bahussutā honti dhātā vacasā paricitā manasānupekkhitā diṭṭhiyā suppaṭividdhā</em>).</p>
<p>When we turn to EĀ 39.4, we find that this quality has been split into two: The third quality is a monk’s learning, and the fourth quality is his possession of the various teachings contained in the Dharma that’s good in the beginning, middle, and end. The monk’s learning must have been about other subjects than the good Dharma in that version. [<a href="#ref19">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n20"><p><em>the noble disciple always conducts himself with mindfulness. He accomplishes right mindfulness, always recollecting and not forgetting what was practiced long ago and what was heard long ago.</em>. C. <span class="ch">聖弟子常行於念。成就正念，久所曾習，久所曾聞，恒憶、不忘</span>, P. <em>ariyasāvako satimā hoti paramena satinepakkena samannāgato cirakatampi cirabhāsitampi saritā anussaritā</em>.</p>
<p>This definition is very similar to that found in AN 7.67.</p>
<p>This item is not found in EĀ 39.4. [<a href="#ref20">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n21"><p><em>the noble disciple cultivates wisdom. He observes the law of arising and decline and attains the noble wisdom and insight that accords with this knowledge. He discerns and comprehends it in order to correctly end suffering.</em>. C. <span class="ch">聖弟子修行智慧。觀興、衰法，得如此智聖慧、明達。分別、曉了以正盡苦</span>, P. <em>ariyasāvako paññavā hoti udayatthagāminiyā paññāya samannāgato ariyāya nibbedhikāya sammā dukkhakkhayagāminiyā</em>.</p>
<p>This definition is very similar to that found in AN 7.67.</p>
<p>EĀ 39.4 also ends its list of seven qualities with wisdom, but there wisdom is defined as fully discerning the aggregates, senses, elements, and principle of the twelve steps of dependent origination. [<a href="#ref21">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n22"><p><em>four progressive mental states.</em>. C. <span class="ch">四增上心</span>, P. <em>catunnañca jhānānaṁ ābhicetasikānaṁ diṭṭhadhammasukhavihārānaṁ</em>.</p>
<p>In AN 7.67, this term includes <em>jhāna</em>. It’s of interest to note that <em>ābhicetasikānaṁ diṭṭhadhammasukhavihārānaṁ</em> is the plural genitive or dative form of <em>ābhicetasika diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāra</em>. Despite this, English translators like Bodhi and Sujato render the compound as “four absorptions that constitute (or belong to) the higher mind.” Actually, <em>ābhicetasikānaṁ</em> and <em>diṭṭhadhammasukhavihārānaṁ</em> are additional synonyms for <em>catunnañca jhānānaṁ</em>. Adding such synonyms was a common way of clarifying a term’s meaning in later Buddhist texts. The whole expression should be read in English as “the four meditations, higher minds, and blissful states in the present life.”</p>
<p>Both here and in EĀ 39.4 this quality of a noble disciple is called the four progressive mental states without any added clarifying terms. EĀ 39.4 doesn’t recite the definition of each meditation, but the four progressive mental states are an alternative name for the four meditations in EĀ 31.1 just as they are here in MĀ 3.</p>
<p>This additional list of four meditations that follows here and in AN 7.67 is not found in EĀ 39.4. [<a href="#ref22">back</a>]</p></li>
