    <td id='p1'>1. Thus I have heard:<sup id="ref1"><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. At the time, he was teaching Dharma to an assembly numbering in the hundreds of thousands that surrounded him front and back.</td>

    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.573c3'>爾時，江側婆羅門，身負重擔，便至世尊所。 到已，捨擔一面，在世尊所，默然而住。 爾時，彼婆羅門作是思惟： 「今日，沙門瞿曇與數千萬眾前後圍遶，而為說法。 我今清淨與沙門瞿曇，等、無有異。 所以然者？ 沙門瞿曇食好粳糧，種種餚饌。 今，我食菓蓏以自濟命。」</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. At the time, a priest on the bank of a river went to the Bhagavān while carrying a heavy load. When he arrived, he set his load down to one side and stood silently in front of the Bhagavān. That priest then had this thought, “Today, the ascetic Gautama is teaching Dharma to an assembly numbering in the hundreds of thousands that surrounds him front and back. Now, I’m equally as clean as that ascetic Gautama, without any difference. Why is that? The ascetic Gautama eats excellent rice and a variety of delicacies. I’m eating fruits and vegetables to sustain myself.”</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.573c9'>爾時，世尊以知婆羅門心中所念，告諸比丘： 「其有眾生以二十一結染著心者。 當觀彼人必墮惡趣不生善處。 云何為二十一結？ 瞋心結，恚害心結，睡眠心結，調戲心結，疑是心結，怒為心結，忌為心結，惱為心結，疾為心結，憎為心結，無慚心結，無愧心結，幻為心結，姦為心結，僞為心結，諍為心結，憍為心結，慢為心結，妬為心結，増上慢為心結，貪為心結。</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. Knowing the thought that was in that priest’s mind, the Bhagavān then addressed the monks, “The minds of some sentient beings are defiled by twenty-one bonds.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> One should observe those people as sure to fall into bad destinies and not be born in a good place. What are the twenty-one bonds? Anger is a mental bond, hatefulness is a mental bond, sleepiness is a mental bond, restlessness is a mental bond, doubt is a mental bond, wrath is a mental bond, jealousy is a mental bond, frustration is a mental bond, envy is a mental bond, dislike is a mental bond, shamelessness is a mental bond, lack of conscience is a mental bond, deception is a mental bond, fraud is a mental bond, dishonesty is a mental bond, enmity is a mental bond, haughtiness is a mental bond, pride is a mental bond, spitefulness is a mental bond, arrogance is a mental bond, and greed is a mental bond.</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0573c01" target="_blank">T125.2.573c1-5a4</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is similar to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn7" target="_blank">MN 7</a> and a closer parallel to MĀ 93 and Taisho 51. SĀ 21.36 (T99.1185) and T100.100 refer to the priest who appears in them but otherwise aren’t parallels to the other three <em>sūtra</em>s. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>twenty-one bonds</em>. This list occurs in different orders and with different translations in the three C. versions, and the terms used are often close synonyms. This makes precise translation difficult in a number of cases. It should be understood that this translation of the list is provisional, and it’s difficult to refine it further without detailed glosses to differentiate synonyms.</p>
<p>It’s of interest to note how the list that appears here, in MĀ 93, and in Taisho 51 has twenty-one items, but MN 7’s list is not numbered and only consists of sixteen items. Also, MĀ 93’s list is of twenty-one defilements rather than bonds, which agrees with MN 7 but not the present <em>sūtra</em> or Taisho 51. These three versions (MN 7, MĀ 93, and EĀ 13.5/T51) appear to be disparate variations of some older text.</p>
<p>This list of twenty-one bonds is also found in two other C. texts known to have been produced by the same translation team that produced EĀ. The first is a translation of an Abhidharma Vibhāṣa (T1547.28.424b6). It appears to reference a scriptural source similar to this <em>sūtra</em> or Taisho 51, though the quotation isn’t sufficient to identify it precisely. The second is a King Aśoka Avadāna text that contains a reference to the twenty-one bonds (T2045.50.172b29).</p>
<p>The same translation team headed by Dao-an was also said to have translated a version of MĀ that was later lost. T51 is one of a group of independent C. translations that parallel MĀ and EĀ <em>sūtra</em>s and that may actually be remnants of this lost MĀ.</p>
<p>Thus, this particular list of twenty-one bonds might be an indication that these texts all belonged to a single branch of early Buddhism. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>Sundarastrī</em>. C. 孫陀羅諦利 (EMC. suən-da-la-tei-lɪi = G. <em>suṃdarastri</em> = S. <em>sundarastrī</em>). This translit. seems straightforward as S. <em>sundara</em> + <em>strī</em>, lit. meaning “beautiful woman.” The 翻梵語 (T2130.54.1019c24) confirms this reading (“譯曰：陀羅者好，諦利者女”). In other sources, however, he is named after the Sundarikā River, which is a feminine noun in S. This makes me wonder what took place to arrive at this situation. Was the priest a woman in this particular telling of the story, or was this name the result of an overly literal translation of S. <em>sundarīka</em> when the text passed from one Prakrit to another?</p>
<p>In MN 7, the priest is called instead P. <em>sundarikabhāradvāja</em>, and simply P. <em>bhāradvāja</em> after he becomes a monk. MĀ 93 has still another name for the priest, translated to C. as 妙好首 (“Chief in Beauty” or “Beautiful Head”). 妙好 could certainly translate S. <em>sundara</em>. 首 could be a translation of S. <em>śīrṣa</em>, <em>śiras</em>, or <em>śrī</em>, which are similar in pronunciation to S. <em>strī</em>.
