    <td id='p1'>1. Thus I have heard:<sup id="ref1"><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> One time, the Buddha was staying on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa near Rājagṛha. He was accompanied by a great assembly of five hundred monks. At the time, Venerable Subhūti was also staying on the side of Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa near Rājagṛha. He had built a separate hut where he sat in meditation.</td>

    <td id='p2'>2. Venerable Subhūti then experienced physical pain that became a serious burden, and he thought, “What is producing these painful feelings of mine? What would cease them? Where would they go?” Venerable Subhūti then prepared a seat out in the open. He sat there cross-legged with upright body, proper mindfulness, and focused mind. He contemplated the senses in order to impede his painful feelings.</td>

Śakra the Lord of Gods then led five hundred gods and Pañcaśikha as they disappeared from the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven and arrived on Vulture’s Peak in the time it takes a strong man to flex his arm.

    <td id='p6'>6. Then, Venerable Subhūti rose from his seat and praised Pañcaśikha, “Good, Pañcaśikha! Your voice combines with your lute and your lute combines with your voice, so that there’s no difference between them. Indeed, the sound of your lute isn’t separate from the sound of your song, and the sound of your song isn’t separate from the sound of your lute.

Śakra then said to Subhūti, “How does the pain that Subhūti is suffering increase or decrease? What has given rise to this physical ailement now?

One thing arises from another, and one thing ceases from another.<sup id="ref4"><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> One thing disturbs another, and one thing stills another. Kausika, it’s like one bitter medicine that also harms another bitter medicine. Lord of the Gods, this is likewise. One thing agitates another, and one thing is stilled by another. One thing can give rise to another, and one thing can cease another.<sup id="ref5"><a href="#n5">5</a></sup> Something black counteracts something white, and something white counteracts something black.

Śakra, it’s like the wind destroying a large tree by stripping off its leaves and limbs. It’s like a hail storm destroying crops, flowers, and fruit. It’s like new sprouts dying without water.

<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0575a29" target="_blank">T125.2.575a29-6a6</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>Pañcaśikha</em>. C. 波遮旬 (EMC. pua-tʃɪă-ziuĕn = G. *<em>pacasun[-?]</em> = S. <em>pañcaśikha</em>?). My best guess, given the context, is that this was a name equivalent to S. Pañcaśikha. The pronunciation of the C. translit. doesn’t match it very well, so it may have been an unknown Prakrit variant. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>Subhūti</em>. C. 善業. Here and in a couple passages below, S. <em>subhūti</em> has been translated to “Good Deed” or “Good Work.” In S., the name generally means “well-being” or “welfare.” It’s of interest to note that the G. pronunciation of Subhūti would’ve been <em>suhuti</em> at times because the language weakened consonants like <em>-bh-</em>. S. <em>-hūti</em> means “invocation” or “calling.” If 業 were read as “profession” this might align with “calling,” but it seems like a stretch. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>One thing arises from another, and one thing ceases from another.</em> C. 法法自生，法法自滅. Or perhaps: “One thing and another arise of themselves, and one thing and another cease of themselves.” I favor reading 自 as a preposition meaning “from,” which accords better with the traditional dependent origination description (“this arises and then that arises”). [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>One thing can give rise to another, and one thing can cease another.</em> C. 法能生法. I’ve adopted the alternate reading which adds 法能滅法 after 法能生法 in the Taisho since the rest of the passage uses pairs of opposites throughout. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
