    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.573a2'>爾時，4那憂羅公長者往至世尊所，頭面禮足，在一面坐。 須臾退坐，白世尊曰： 「我今年朽，加復抱病。 多諸憂惱。 唯願，世尊，隨時教訓，使眾生類長夜獲安隱。」</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the wealthy man Grandfather Nakula<sup id="ref3"><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> came to the Bhagavān, bowed at his feet, and sat to one side. Immediately upon withdrawing to his seat, he said to the Bhagavān, “I’m old and weak and wrapped in illness on top of that. My miseries are many. Please, Bhagavān, give instruction on this occasion so that sentient beings will obtain their safety for the long night.”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.573a5'>爾時，世尊告長者曰： 「如汝所言，身多畏痛何可恃怙。 但以薄皮而覆其上。 長者，當知其有依憑此身者，正可須臾之樂，此是愚心，非智慧者所貴。</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. The Bhagavān then said to that wealthy man, “As you say, how can one depend upon a body with its many infirmities? It has just this thin skin covering it. Wealthy man, you should know that, even when happy momentarily, relying on this body is a foolish idea not valued by the wise.</td>

    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.573a10'>爾時，長者聞説斯言，從坐起，禮世尊足，便退而去。 爾時，長者復作是念： 「我今可往至尊者舍利弗所，問斯義。」 舍利弗去彼，不遠在樹下坐。 是時，那優羅公往至舍利弗所，頭面禮足，在一面坐。</td>
    <td id='p5'>5. Upon hearing these words, that wealthy man then rose from his seat, bowed at the Bhagavān’s feet, withdrew, and departed. That wealthy man then thought, “Now, I could go over to Venerable Śāriputra and ask him the meaning of this.” Śāriputra had departed, but he was sitting not far away under a tree. Grandfather Nakula went to Śāriputra, bowed his head at his feet, and then sat to one side.</td>

    <td id='p8'>8. The wealthy man replied, “Here, Śāriputra, I went to the Bhagavān, bowed my head at his feet, and sat to one side. Then, I said to him, ‘I’ve grown old and weak, and I’m always wrapped in illness. My many pains are indescribable.

    <td id='p9'>9. “The Bhagavān then told me, ‘So it is, wealthy man. This body has many infirmities, and it has just this thin skin covering it. Wealthy man, you should know that, even when momentarily happy, one who relies on this body doesn’t know the long night of suffering they’ve experienced, which is measureless. Therefore, wealthy man, though this body has its troubles, you should make your heart untroubled. Thus, wealthy man, you should train yourself.’ That was how the Bhagavān watered me with the Dharma of ambrosia.”</td>

The wealthy man said to Śāriputra, “It’s true that I didn’t ask the Bhagavān questions about the body having its troubles and the mind being troubled, or about the body having its troubles but the mind being untroubled.

    <td id='p13'>13. Śāriputra told the wealthy man, “Here, wealthy man, there’s an ordinary person who doesn’t meet a noble person. They don’t receive the noble teaching or follow its instruction. They don’t meet good friends or accompany good friends. As a result of this, they imagine that form is self, that form belongs to self, that self belongs to form, that self is in form, or that form is in self. [They imagine that] other form and self form combine in one place, or that other form and self form collect in one place. Form then deteriorates, changes, and doesn’t remain.

    <td id='p16'>16. Śāriputra said, “Here, wealthy man, a noble disciple serves a noble, cultivates the discipline, and accompanies good friends. From this, they are close to good friends. They don’t observe self as possessing form, and they don’t view self as being in form or that form is in self. They don’t view form as belonging to self or that self belongs to form. That form [deteriorates,] changes, and doesn’t remain. The changing of that form doesn’t give rise to the suffering of sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble.</td>

<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0573a01" target="_blank">T125.2.573a1-b29</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.1" target="_blank">SN 22.1</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>the Yakṣiṇī’s Grove</em>. C. 鬼林, P. <em>bhesakaḷāvana</em>, S. <em>bhīsanikāvana</em>. In both the P. and S. tradition, this grove was named after a female <em>yakṣa</em> which was considered to be the forest’s guardian. 鬼 (“demon”) typically translated S. <em>yakṣa</em>, so I’ve chosen to translate the placename as the Yakṣiṇī’s Grove.</p>
<p><em>Śiśumāragiri</em>. 尸牧摩羅山 (EMC. ʃɪi-mɪuk-mua-la + C. “mountain” = G. <em>śimukamara</em> = S. <em>śiśumāragiri</em>, “crocodile”), P. <em>susumāra</em>. This was the name of the capitol city of Bharga. It would seem that a corruption of the translit. has taken place, either in the original Pkt. or the C. text. The Taisho reading has <em>-muk-</em> where we would expect <em>-śu-</em>. The 翻梵語 (T2130.54.1043a2) tells us that 尸牧摩羅 means “child killer,” which is the lit. meaning of S. <em>śiśumāra</em> (<em>śiśu-</em> = child and <em>-māra</em> = killing). This confirms that it was the same placename (which idiomatically means “Mount Crocodile” in S.). Later C. editors corrected the translit. to 尸收摩羅 (EMC. ʃɪi-ʃɪəu-mua-la = G. <em>śiśumara</em>), indicating that they were aware of the S. pronunciation.</p>
<p><em>the country of Bharga</em>. C. 拔祇國 (EMC. bʌt-giĕ + C. “country” = G. <em>*bhaga</em>), P. Bhagga, S. Bharga. I’ve adopted the S. attestation for the G., which lacks an attestation. Gandhari generally didn’t allow double consonants like S. <em>-rg-</em> and P. <em>-gg-</em>), so it likely would have been G. <em>bhaga</em>. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>Grandfather Nakula</em>. C. 那憂羅公 (EMC. na-•ɪəu-la + C. “grandfather”? = G. <em>na’ulapida</em>? = S. <em>nakulapitā</em>, “Grandfather Nakula”?), P. <em>nakulapitā</em>. Another parallel is SĀ 1.175 (T99.107), where his name is translit. as 那拘羅 (EMC. na-kɪu-la = G. <em>nakula</em> = S. <em>nakula</em>), which lacks the addition of P. <em>pitā</em>. 公 means “grandfather” or an “official” rather than simply “father,” indicating that perhaps the addition of <em>pitā</em> was more a comment on Nakula’s advanced years than a relationship to someone else. However, in the Theravāda <em>sutta</em>s there is a pair of characters called P. Nakulapitā (“Nakula’s father”) and P. Nakulamātā (“Nakula’s mother”), so perhaps the stories surrounding them differed from one tradition to the next. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p>There are a couple notable differences between this translation of Nakula’s request and the one at the start of the <em>sūtra</em>. My assumption is that this is a case of inconsistent translation or perhaps the result of later editing and/or textual corruption, which are problems that we often contend with throughout EĀ. This version, though, appears to be closer to the original, given that here Nakula directly asks the Buddha about the nature of the body and its infirmities. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
