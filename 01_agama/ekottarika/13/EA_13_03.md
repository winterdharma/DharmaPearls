    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that there was a prominent man in the city of Śrāvastī who’s son had recently died. He had been loving and devoted, and they had never been apart before. When he saw his son dead, he became distraught as a result. He went in circles, came and went, and didn’t stay in one place. When he saw someone, he would ask them, “Have you seen my child?”</td>

    <td id='p3'>3. That man eventually made his way to Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove. He went to the Bhagavān and stood to one side. That man then asked the Bhagavān, “Ascetic Gautama, have you seen my child?”</td>

    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.571c5'>世尊告長者曰： 「何故顏貎不悦，諸根錯亂？」</td>

    <td id='p5'>5. The man replied, “Gautama, I couldn’t be otherwise. Why is that? Now, I had an only son who left me due to impermanence. He was loving and devoted, and he had never been out my sight before. I feel so much pity for my son, so much that I’ve gone mad. Now, I ask you, ascetic, ‘Have you seen my child?’”</td>

    <td id='p6'>6. The Bhagavān told him, “So it is, prominent man. As you’ve asked, birth, old age, illness, and death are the constant principles of the world. It’s painful to be separated from loved ones and painful to associate with enemies. Your son left you due to impermanence, so how could you not think of him?”</td>

    <td id='p12'>12. At some point later, Great King Prasenajit and Queen Mālikā were up in their high tower entertaining each other.

    <td id='p13'>13. King Prasenajit told her, “The teacher instructs his disciple, ‘Do this, abandon that.’ The disciple replies, ‘Yes, great teacher!’ You’re like that, Mālikā. Although the ascetic Gautama said that, your response is to say, ‘Yes, it’s not otherwise. There’s nothing false about it.’ You can go now. I have no need of you in my presence.”</td>

Go to the Tathāgata in my name and kneel at the Tathāgata’s feet.

Is your eyesight going dark? Are you without troubles?’ She also said this: ‘Everyone in the city of Śrāvastī and the palace have been telling each other this, “The ascetic Gautama said: ‘Separation from loved ones and association with enemies are both delightful’!” Is it inaccurate to say that the Bhagavān taught this?’”</td>

    <td id='p17'>17. The Bhagavān then told the priest Nāḷijaṅgha, “There’s a prominent man here in Śrāvastī whose only son has died. He became distraught thinking about his son, and he lost his composure. He rushed east and west, asking anyone whom he met, ‘Has anyone seen my son?’ Indeed, priest, it’s painful to be separated from loved ones and painful to associate with enemies.

<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0571b28" target="_blank">T125.2.571b28-2c29</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is a parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn87" target="_blank">MN 87</a>, MĀ 216, T91, and T154.15. It would appear to have originated as an <em>avadāna</em> story that belongs to a genre about lay Buddhists dealing with doubters and situations that test their belief. This was a common theme in <em>avadāna</em> collections like the <em>Mahāsūtrālaṃkāra</em> by Aśvaghoṣa (trans. Kumārajīva, T201). Here, the primary story is of Queen Mālikā dealing with misrepresentations of the Buddha that caused her husband to dismiss her faith.</p>
<p>This <em>sūtra</em> is titled Nāḷijaṅgha (竹膞, lit. “bamboo shank”) in the summary verse at the end of the Chapter 13. This is the name of a priest whom Mālikā sends to investigate a false rumor. Both MN 87 and MĀ 216 name the <em>sūtra</em> “Born from Love” (Piyajātika and 愛生, respectively), which references the background story of how the rumor started. The version found in a C. Jātaka collection (T154, No. 15) also names it after this background story, but there it’s titled “The Death of a Son” (子命過). Anshigao’s translation (T91) is titled similarly as “A Loving Priest Loses His Son and Can’t Part with Him” (婆羅門子命終愛念不離).</p>
<p>The most interesting difference between these versions is that the Jātaka story makes no mention of a false rumor or the argument between Prasenajit and Queen Mālikā. This suggests that perhaps the canonical <em>sūtra</em> version has been greatly expanded. Given this, we can see why some versions were titled after the initial story, for it was the original name of a text that was built up. The tradition represented by EĀ perhaps put more emphasis on the teaching the Buddha gives to Nāḷijaṅgha at the midpoint of the narrative and titled the <em>sūtra</em> accordingly.

<li id="n2"><p><em>Nāḷijaṅgha</em>. C. 竹膊. The Taisho reading here translates the priest’s name to C. 竹膊, which lit. means “bamboo shoulder.” 竹 generally agrees with the P. <em>nāḷi</em>, which means a “tube.” Bamboo stalks are hollow tubes. However, there was some confusion between 膊 (“shoulder”) and 膞 (“shank”), where 膊 appears in the <em>sūtra</em> text and 膞 in the summary verse. Given that 膞 agrees with P. and S. <em>jaṅgha</em> and how easily the two characters could be mistaken for each other, I’m assuming that 膊 was a copyist error. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>Vaiḍūrya</em>. C. 琉璃. The C. here (lit. “beryl” or “emerald”) typically translates S. <em>vaiḍūrya</em> (G. <em>veḍuriya</em>). This may refer to the same prince that P. names <em>viḍūḍabha</em> or <em>viṭaṭūbha</em>, given the instability of personal names we sometimes see in Buddhist texts. There is also a C. alt. reading as 流離 (EMC. lɪəu-lɪĕ, meaning lit. “stream let go”), but it doesn’t suggest an Indic name that I recognize. I’ve adopted the straightforward S. equivalent of the C. for the time being. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>Ela</em>. C. 伊羅 (EMC. ɪi-la = G. <em>ela</em>?). This name is unknown to me as a prince of Prasenajit. The C. translit. could represent Indic sounds like G. <em>ela</em> (“water”), <em>era</em>, <em>ira</em> (a Babylonian month), or <em>ila</em>. The ending of the name has likely been truncated, but it’s difficult to guess what it was. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>Śaradā</em>. C. 薩羅陀 (EMC. sat-la-da = G. <em>sarada</em>?). 翻梵語 (T2130.54.1019c23) says that the translit. should be 賖羅陀 (EMC. ʃɪă-la-da = G. <em>śarada</em>, lit. “autumn”) and claims that the word means “clear and bright” (perhaps referring to the autumn moon). P. has instead Vāsabhā for this name. It also indicates that this is a warrior woman. The C. gives no indication of gender here, but shortly she’ll be referred to as one of Prasenajit’s wives.
