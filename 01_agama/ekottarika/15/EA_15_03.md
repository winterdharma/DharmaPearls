This <em>sūtra</em> is parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.141" target="_blank">AN 2.141</a>. The next two also appear to be generally parallel to AN 2.141-150. This would appear to be another case of the curators of AN expanding a couple older <em>sūtra</em>s into a full chapter of ten. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>material gifts</em>. C. 財施. The Pali parallel has <em>āmisadāna</em>. <em>Āmisa</em> generally means physical things. Sometimes it means specifically food or bodily concerns, but it can also been worldly possessions and wealth. It seems likely the same underlying term was translated here, but it was interpreted as possessions (presumably those typical of alms giving). [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
