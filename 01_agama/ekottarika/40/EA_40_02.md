Go there and exchange greetings with the Bhagavān, bow to him, and then deliver this message, ‘King Ajātaśatru says to the Bhagavān, “I am thinking about attacking the country of the Vṛji. Would that be advisable?”’ Whatever the Tathāgata says, remember it well and then come back and tell it to me. Why is that? The Tathāgata’s statements are never duplicitous.”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0738a11" target="_blank">T125.2.738a11-c19</a>. Direct parallels to this <em>sūtra</em> include <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an7.22" target="_blank">AN 7.22</a>, <a href="../../madhyama/MA_142.html" target="_blank">MĀ 142</a>, and <a href="../../../02_avadana/dharmapada/T211/T211c36v1.html" target="_blank">Chapter 36 of <cite>Dharma Verse Stories</cite></a> (T211). This story serves as the introduction to most versions of the <cite>Parinirvāṇa Sūtra</cite> (cf. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16" target="_blank">DN 16</a>, <a href="../../dirgha/DA_2.html" target="_blank">DĀ 2</a>, T5, T6, T1451, and the Sanskrit edition). The parallels in the <cite>Parinirvāṇa Sūtra</cite> are greatly expanded with a series of lists taught to the monks after Varṣākāra’s departure. Here, there is only the first list of things for the Saṅgha to practice.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this <em>sūtra</em> seems to represent a fairly early version of the story, but it has developed further compared to the simplest versions found in T211 and AN 7.22. Ānanda appears in this version, but only as the person the Buddha addresses when enumerating the seven things that the Vṛji should practice. The Buddha also teaches seven practices to the community of monks after Varṣākāra leaves, as he does in the other parallels besides T211 and AN 7.22.</p>
<p>That said, the lists in this version don’t correspond well to either the Sarvāstivāda/Theravāda parallels (MĀ 142, T1451, Sanskrit edition, AN 7.22, and DN 16) or the version found in T211, T5, and T6. It must have been from another tradition that exerted little influence on the others. Generally speaking, this version has a greater focus on practicing the religious life than the unity of the Saṅgha. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>This observation is not found in the other versions of this story. Its purpose seems to be to explain why the Buddha addresses Ānanda instead of Varṣākāra for the rest of the discourse. The same thing is accomplished in the more familiar versions of the story by having the Buddha ask Ānanda if the Vṛji were following his previous advice to them. But we should note that the simplest version (T211) does not involve Ānanda at all.</p>
<p>This suggests that the versions involving Ānanda might be a fusion of two stories: One of Ajātaśatru sending Varṣākāra to the Buddha, and another in which the Buddha taught the seven principles to Ānanda. When the two stories were combined, a segue was needed to make the change in interlocutor more natural.</p>
<p>Another explanation might be that some traditions held Varṣākāra in contempt for his association with Ajātaśatru and depicted the Buddha snubbing him. There are certainly other instances of this kind, such as the Buddha’s contemptuous treatment of Ānanda in the <cite>Parinirvāṇa Sūtra</cite>, which may actually be an expression of later opinions about him. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p>This first item differs from the other versions, which generally agree on holding frequent meetings. Here, the Buddha seems to be giving the Vṛji the military advice to gather all their forces into a single army. This was indeed wise counsel in ancient times when battles were generally won by the larger army. A single large force could easily defeat several smaller armies if they were disunited. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p>This second item is also echoed in the other versions. However, only DĀ 2 makes specific mention of people in high and low positions being in harmony. T211 and T5 mention the people and the elite or the elite and ministers being in harmony. The Sarvāstivāda/Theravāda versions express the Vṛji unity as doing everything in unison. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p>This third item is unique to this version of the list. It echoes the sentiment of item four in MĀ 142 and T1451 and five in AN 7.22/DN 16, which mention acts of violation towards women such as adultery, rape, and abduction. Here, this seems to have changed to not lusting after women, generally. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p>This fourth item references divisive speech, which involves spreading rumors between groups or communities that cause conflict or mistrust between them. It doesn’t have a direct parallel in the other versions of this list. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p>This fifth item is similar to the last principle in T211 and DĀ 2 in that it only mentions ascetics and brahmins rather than <em>arhat</em>s. The other versions only mention <em>arhat</em>s, which is perhaps a sign of alienation between Buddhists and other religions in later eras. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p>This sixth item lacks a parallel in the other versions of the list, which advise respect for traditional shrines, spirits, and gods. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n9"><p>This last principle also lacks a direct parallel in the other versions of this list. There is mention here of spirits and shrines that was found in the previous item in the other lists, but it seems out of place here. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n10"><p>This first item echoes the first one in the previous list but the second item has also been merged with it. In DĀ 2 and T5, the second item remains separate from the first in the list. [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n11"><p>This second item has the same sentiment as we find in the Sarvāstivāda and Theravāda versions (i.e., MĀ 142, T1451, the Sanskrit edition, and DN 16), which depict the monks acting in unison as they sit, rise, and carry out their duties. Here, we get only a basic statement of their unity. [<a href="#ref11">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n12"><p>There’s no parallel for this third item in the other versions. [<a href="#ref12">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n13"><p>This fourth item is also unique to this version of the list. [<a href="#ref13">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n14"><p>This fifth item most likely refers to the practice of meditating or contemplating the Dharma late into the night, and thus requires the ability to remain awake and alert. It doesn’t have a parallel in the other versions of the list. [<a href="#ref14">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n15"><p>This sixth item is partially parallel to the sixth item in DN 16, MĀ 142, T1451, and the Sanskrit edition. The mention of mathematics is unique, however, and probably refers to the type of work that literate people often were given in ancient times: tallying ledgers, keeping records of trade, laying out building plans, and so forth, which required skill in mathematics. [<a href="#ref15">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n16"><p>This seventh item is unique to this list. The final item in the other parallels echoes the last item in the previous list about honoring and supporting those of the religious community (or <em>arhat</em>s in particular). [<a href="#ref16">back</a>]</p></li>
