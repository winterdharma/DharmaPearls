The honored spirits and gods in the sky took heavenly flowers in hand and scattered them over Venerable Ānanda and the fourfold assembly. All the gods, <em>nāga</em>s, <em>yakṣa</em> spirits, <em>gandharva</em>s, <em>asura</em>s, <em>garuḍa</em>s, <em>kiṃnara</em>s, and <em>mahoraga</em>s felt joyous and praised him: “Good, Venerable Ānanda! Good! In the beginning, middle, and end, none of your words aren’t good. They revere the Dharma as it should be, and they’re spoken sincerely. There’s nothing achieved by gods and worldly people that doesn’t come from the Dharma. Anyone who does evil will fall to hell or be born among hungry ghosts and animals.”</td>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0549b12" target="_blank">T125.2.549b12-52c7</a>. I do not know of any direct parallels for this introduction, but it shares many elements with other texts. The story of Ānanda reciting the <em>sūtra</em>s has parallels in the various Vinaya accounts of the first council after the Buddha’s <em>parinirvāṇa</em>. King Dirghāyu and Makhadeva also are characters who appear in Buddhist <em>avadāna</em> texts, some of which are included in EBTs such as <a href="../madhyama/MA_072.html" target="_blank">MĀ 72</a> and <a href="suttacentral.net/mn83" target="_blank">MN 83</a>. The verse that Ānanda recites for Mahākāśyapa is a famous one: It’s verse 183 in the <cite>Dhammapāda</cite> and appears in a variety of sources such as DN 14, Vinaya texts, and parallels to the <cite>Dhammapāda</cite> in other languages. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>Śākyamuni.</em> C. <span class="ch">能仁</span>. Lit. “The Humane One.” This was an uncommon translation of Śākyamuni.</p>
<p><em>Seventh Sage.</em> This refers to the Buddha being the last of a lineage of seven Buddhas. For sources on the topic, see the <cite>Mahāvadāna Sūtra</cite> and its parallels (<a href="../../dirgha/DA_1.html" target="_blank">DĀ 1</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn14" target="_blank">DN 14</a>, EĀ 48.4, and Taisho 2-4).</p>
<p><em>Unsurpassed law.</em> C. <span class="ch">無上軌</span>. Here, S. <em>dharma</em> has been translated as “law” (<span class="ch">軌</span>), which is also the meaning of the usual C. translation (<span class="ch">法</span>). [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n3"><p><em>four immeasurables.</em> C. <span class="ch">四等</span>(<span class="ch">心</span>), S. <em>catvāry-apramāṇāni</em>, P. <em>catasso appamaññāyo</em>. Lit. “four thoroughnesses,” this was a translation of the four immeasurables (kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity). These were the subjects of a meditative practice also known as the four abodes of Brahma (S. <em>catvāro brahma-vihārāḥ</em>) because it was considered a way to be born in the Brahma Heaven. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n4"><p>It’s notable that Ānanda is not criticized as stupid by Mahākāśyapa in this version of events, nor does his being an <em>arhat</em> or not play a part in his qualification as wise or learned. His deprecation in other accounts vs. his praiseworthiness here may well have been later editorializing by sectarian authors, given that the accounts are so different in this regard. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n5"><p><em>numberless assembly</em>. Lit. “assembly of 84,000” (C. <span class="ch">八萬四千眾</span>).</p>
<p><em>liberation.</em> Lit. “liberation of mind” (C. <span class="ch">心解脫</span>).</p>
<p><em>freed from bondage.</em> I’ve simplified this line for brevity. Lit. “Become fields of merit by freeing themselves from the place of bonds and attachments.” Presumably, these last two lines refer only to the monks and nuns and not all four assemblies. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n6"><p><em>for three</em> asaṃkhya <em>eons.</em> C.<span class="ch">三阿僧祇</span>. This is an reference to the concept of a long <em>bodhisattva</em> career that spans three “innumerable eons” (S. <em>asaṃkhya kalpa</em>) of past lives. Thus, we see here the influence of <em>jātaka</em> literature, wherein this concept was first developed. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n7"><p><em>hero.</em> C. <span class="ch">世雄</span>. Lit. “world hero.” Likely equiv. to S. <em>mahāvīra</em> (“great hero”), which was an epithet of the Buddha, and commonly used for great persons in India. Thus, he was considered the Buddha’s equal.</p>
<p><em>half seats.</em> C. <span class="ch">半坐</span>. I don’t know the Indic equiv. for this expression, but context seems to indicate they asked for lower or smaller seats than Kāśyapa’s out of deference. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n8"><p><em>three pure eyes.</em> C. <span class="ch">三清淨眼</span>. This refers to the physical eye, divine eye, and Dharma eye. The physical eye is the mortal eye made of flesh. The divine eye is the power of clairovoyance possessed by gods. The Dharma eye is a metaphorical vision that comprehends the Dharma directly. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n9"><p><em>Ekottarika.</em> C. <span class="ch">増一</span>. Throughout the Introduction, <cite>Ekottarika</cite> is translated as 増一, which was equiv. to <span class="ch">增壹</span>. I’ve chosen to translate and transliterate this term as “increasing by one” or “Ekottarika” depending on context. Some passages are discussing the method of organizing the <em>sūtra</em>s, and others are referring to the Āgama by its title. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n10"><p>pāramitā<em>s</em>. C. <span class="ch">度無極</span>. The Chinese translation appears to interpret S. <em>pāramitā</em> as “crossing” (<span class="ch">度</span>, S. <em>pār-</em>) “the limitless” (<span class="ch">無極</span>, S. <em>amita</em>). I’ve reverted to the S. for both brevity and clarity. [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n11"><p><em>chop their hands and feet off.</em> This is probably a reference to a well-known <em>jātaka</em> tale about an ascetic who was punished for socializing with a jealous king’s women by having his hands and feet amputated. The story is often cited as an illustration of the <em>pāramitā</em> of tolerance, perhaps most famously in the <cite>Diamond Sūtra</cite> (S. <cite>Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra</cite>) For the original <em>jātaka</em> story, see e.g. the <cite>Khantivadi Jātaka</cite> in Pali sources (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja313" target="_blank">Jā 313</a>). [<a href="#ref11">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n12"><p><em>Opposing practices.</em> C. <span class="ch">妨人諸行</span>. Lit. “Opposing a person’s practices.” Also, <span class="ch">諸行</span> may translate a word related to S. <em>saṃskāra</em>, which could mean “conditioned things” or “mental activity” in general. The four right efforts that are the basic template for this paramita involves disciplining one’s habits generally, so “practices” can refer to mental habits, too. [<a href="#ref12">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n13"><p><em>breathe in and out.</em> C. <span class="ch">出入息</span>. This would likely be a reference to the mindfulness of breathing practice. [<a href="#ref13">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n14"><p><em>those freed by faith.</em> C. <span class="ch">信解脫</span>, P. <em>saddhāvimutta</em>. This refers to a level of trainee who has partially destroyed the contaminants and firmly planted their faith in the Tathāgata. Cf. MĀ 195 & MN 70, which discuss the stages of the trainee. This passage is saying that, aside from those who hadn’t achieved liberation or a measure of it, Buddhists had a difficult time accepting the authenticity of <em>bodhisattva</em> practices. [<a href="#ref14">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n15"><p><em>set out for awakening.</em> C. <span class="ch">發道意</span>. The straightforward reading of this expression is as a translation of S. <em>bodhi-cittopāda.</em>  Hirakawa lists possible underlying Indic expressions as S. <em>cittopāda,</em> <em>paribodhita,</em> and <em>bodhaye saṃprastithaḥ.</em> [<a href="#ref15">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n16"><p><em>land of the Śākya Lion.</em> C. <span class="ch">薩迦尸國</span> (EMC. sat-kă-ʃɪi = G. *Sakaṣi-). My guess is that <span class="ch">薩迦尸</span> transliterated the equivalent of S. <em>śākyasiṃha</em> (“the Śākya Lion”), which in extant G. was <em>śakasiha</em>. I.e., the entire term refers to the Buddha’s homeland (Kapilavastu). This would match the story in EĀ 24.5, which says the Buddha visited his father after converting the Kāśyapa brothers. [<a href="#ref16">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n17"><p>This is the opening of the first <em>sūtra</em> of the <cite>Ekottarika Āgama</cite> (EĀ 2.1). [<a href="#ref17">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n18"><p>This discribes the contents of Chapters 3 and 4. Kauṇḍinya was the first to understand the four noble truths, and this Subhadra is likely the last to be liberated just before the Buddha <em>parinirvāṇa</em>-ed. [<a href="#ref18">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n19"><p><em>a mixed piṭaka.</em> C. <span class="ch">雜藏</span>. This translation suggests that the fourth <em>piṭaka</em> in this school’s canon was called S. <cite>Saṃyukta</cite> rather than S. <cite>Kṣudraka</cite>. Nonetheless, the description sounds similar to the Theravāda’s <cite>Khuddaka Nikāya</cite>, containing a <em>jātaka</em> collection of stories illustrating the Bodhisattva’s practice and other <em>sūtra</em> collections. We are left to wonder what texts specifically were meant by the “expansive Mahāyāna doctrine” (C. <span class="ch">方等大乘義</span>, S. <em>vaipulya mahāyāna artha</em>). We can only guess. [<a href="#ref19">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n20"><p>This last line implies that Ānanda is not yet an <em>arhat</em> after reciting and organizing the <em>sūtra</em>s. Other accounts of these events depict a conflict between Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda, the former forcing the latter to finish the task of becoming an <em>arhat</em> before allowing him into the council proceedings. This was apparently one of the many disagreements between the early schools: Whether someone not yet an <em>arhat</em> could possess wisdom or not. Ānanda was the principle example, and Vinaya accounts of the first council were written according to the position taken. Apparently, the author(s) of this account were among the camp that held that a trainee could be wise. [<a href="#ref20">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n21"><p><em>Paranirmitavaśavartin gods … Nirmāṇarati gods.</em> The Taisho edition has the order of these heavens reversed, which is the result of a single character (<span class="ch">他</span>) being moved from one to the other. I’ve corrected the typo in my translation. [<a href="#ref21">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n22"><p><em>Ekottara.</em> C. <span class="ch">伊倶優多羅</span> (EMC. i-kɪu ɪəu-ta-la = G. <em>*ekutara</em>). The G. equivalent of S. <em>ekottarika</em> is attested as G. <em>ekutariga</em>. The C. transliteration here looks very close to G. <em>ekutara</em>, so I’ve adopted the S. equivalent as a best guess.</p>
<p><em>Mukhottara.</em> C. <span class="ch">目伽優多羅</span> (EMC. mɪuk-k‘ie ɪəu-ta-la = G. <em>*mukhetara</em>). <span class="ch">目伽</span> most likely transliterates G. <em>mukha</em>, so I’ve adopted the S. equiv. of G. <em>Mukha+utara</em>.</p>
<p><em>Nagottara.</em> C. <span class="ch">龍優多羅</span>. Here, we have a translation of G. <em>naga</em> (<span class="ch">龍</span>) and a transliteration of <em>utara.</em> [<a href="#ref22">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n23"><p><em>Vidyūttara.</em> C. <span class="ch">雷電優多羅</span> (EMC. ɪəu-ta-la = G. <em>utara</em>). Here, we have a translation of “lightning” and a transliteration of G. <em>utara.</em> I’ve guessed S. <em>vidyūttara</em> as a likely Indic equivalent.</p>
<p><em>Devottara.</em> C. <span class="ch">天優多羅</span>. Here, we have a translation of Indic <em>deva</em> and transliteration of G. <em>utara</em>. I’ve adopted the S. equivalent of G. <em>deva</em> + <em>utara</em>.</p>
<p><em>Brahmottara.</em> C. <span class="ch">梵優多羅</span> (EMC. bɪʌm ɪəu-ta-la = G. Braṃmotara). Here, we have a transliteration of G. <em>braṃma</em> + <em>utara</em>. The equivalent would be S. <em>Brahmottara</em>, which is attested in other contexts. [<a href="#ref23">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n24"><p><em>Makhādeva.</em> C. <span class="ch">摩訶提婆</span> (EMC. mua-he-dei-bua = G. <em>Mahadeva</em>), P. <em>Makhādeva</em>, S. <em>Mahādeva</em>. The following <em>avadāna</em> story has parallels in other sources. In Pali, it’s found in Jā 541 and MN 83, where the king’s name is Makhādeva rather than Mahādeva, which is found in S. sources. In Chinese sources, the transliteration in both early and late translations is S. Mahādeva, too (cf. MĀ 67, T152 No. 87, and T211 C. 38, and EĀ 50.4). This is interesting insofar as the G. dialect transliterated to C. often changed <em>-kh-</em> to <em>-h-</em>. This raises the possibility that the P. tradition has preserved the original Prakrit pronunciation, while later S. sources did not when translated from G. I’ve adopted the P. equivalent based on this. [<a href="#ref24">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n25"><p><em>Mango Park.</em> C. <span class="ch">甘梨園</span>. We don’t get a full location here, but <span class="ch">甘梨園</span> was used in T212 for the Āmravana of Vaisali, so I assume <span class="ch">甘梨</span> (lit. “sweet pear”) was intended as an approx. of S. <em>āmra</em> (mango). [<a href="#ref25">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n26"><p><em>rainbow.</em> C. <span class="ch">五色光</span>. Lit. “five-colored light.” [<a href="#ref26">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n27"><p><em>barber</em>. C. <span class="ch">劫比</span> (MC. kɪʌp-pii = G. <em>*kapi-</em>). I’m reading this transliteration as equivalent to P. <em>kappaka</em> (S. <em>kalpaka</em>), meaning a barber. It would fit the Indic parallels to this <em>jātaka</em> story (cf. Jā 541, MN 83). It is possible that this is a personal name that meant “like a barber” (i.e., G. <em>*kapika</em>). [<a href="#ref27">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n28"><p><em>enjoyed</em>. C. <span class="ch">食</span>. Lit. “eaten” or “fed on” (<span class="ch">食</span>). [<a href="#ref28">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n29"><p><em>Dīrghāyu.</em> C. <span class="ch">長壽</span>. Translated lit. as “Long Life Span.” There’s another mythical King Dīrghāyu who played a prominent role in a story told to the Kauśāmbī monks in <a href="../../madhyama/MA_072.html" target="_blank">MĀ 72</a>.</p>
<p><em>three muddy roads.</em> C. <span class="ch">三塗</span>. This was an alternate translation of S. <em>trividhā durgatiḥ</em>, also translated as the “three unfortunate destinations” (i.e., rebirth among animals, hungry ghosts, and in hell). It was more commonly translated to C. as <span class="ch">三惡趣</span> (“three bad destinations”).</p>
<p><em>eight difficulties.</em> C. <span class="ch">八難</span>. This refers to eight situations that prevent sentient beings from achieving liberation. The list varies some from source to source. Four difficulties are not being born among humans (i.e., hell, hungry ghosts, animals, and gods). Four other difficulties involve not encountering the Buddha’s teaching or being unable to practice it. This typically includes things like not being born in a civilized land, not finding a good teacher, not having the capacity to hear or understand it, and living during a time when there is no Buddha. [<a href="#ref29">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n30"><p>From this verse down to the verse spoken by Ānanda, I’ve translated an excerpt appended to the end of fascicle 1 of the <cite>Taisho</cite> edition (cf. T125.2.553c5-c24). Apparently, a page of Chinese was lost and found again. I’ve put it back in its proper place in this story. [<a href="#ref30">back</a>]</p></li> 
<li id="n31"><p><em>Sudarśana.</em> C. <span class="ch">善觀</span>. Translated lit. as “Good Observation.” This is an educated guess given the context. S. <em>darśana</em> was often translated as <span class="ch">見</span>, but related terms like <span class="ch">現</span> were sometimes used. [<a href="#ref31">back</a>]</p></li>
