<li id="n2"><p><em>There isn’t anything in this assembly greater than this one thing</em>. C. 於此眾中無有一法勝此法者. This final <em>sūtra</em> of the chapter has a different translation of the opening line that makes better sense than the rest. Lit., it reads: “There isn’t a single thing greater than this thing …” This does at least confirm that it is what was intended. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p>The first statement beginning these conclusions has been lost. Since these pithy statements were unique to each text, I’ve not tried to reconstruct it. Presumably, it was along the lines of “Therefore, monks, you should train in not drinking alcohol.” [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
