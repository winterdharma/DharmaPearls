    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.576b3'>爾時，世尊告諸比丘： 「於此眾中，我不見一法修行已、多修行已，成地獄行、餓鬼、畜生行。 若生人中，極為貧匱。 衣不蓋形，食不充口。 所謂劫盜也。</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I don’t see anything in this assembly like one thing that when cultivated and cultivated often accomplishes the actions of hell, actions of hungry ghosts, and actions of animal births. If they were born among humans, a person will be made impoverished by it. They won’t have clothes to cover themselves or enough food to eat. What is that one thing? It’s stealing.”</td>

    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.576b6'>「諸比丘，若有人意好劫盜，取他財物，便墮餓鬼、畜生中。 若生人中、極為貧匱。 所以然者？ 以斷他生業故。</td>

The Buddha told the monks, “If a person likes thinking about stealing and taking valuable possessions from others, then they’ll fall into hell, among hungry ghosts, or among animals.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> If they are born among humans, they’ll be made impoverished by it. Why is that? Because they ended the livelihood of others.</td>
