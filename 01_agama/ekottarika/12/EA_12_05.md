<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0569c13" target="_blank">T125.2.569c13-70a22</a>. Although this <em>sūtra</em> doesn’t appear to have a direct parallel, we do find similar material in SĀ 41.6 (1141), T100.116, and SN 16.5, where Kāśyapa says that he praises the ascetic practices. These are parallels to the next <em>sūtra</em>, EĀ 12.6, which doesn’t depict Kāśyapa as praising these things. Rather, he is praised for practicing them when the Buddha allows him to retire in his old age. The praising of the practices occurs instead here in the present <em>sūtra</em>, which mentions Kāśyapa at the end. It would appear that the Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda traditions may have combined elements of <em>sūtra</em>s like EĀ 12.5 and 12.6. The older <em>sūtra</em>s in those traditions would not have been identical to those here in the EĀ version, however, since their lists of the ascetic practices are different than the one we find here. It’s notable that a list of twelve ascetic practices similar to this one is found in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya (cf. T1421.22.26a18), and there’s a short Mahāyāna <em>sūtra</em> on the subject (T783) that appears inspired by these early <em>sūtra</em>s. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>dwell in one place for one sitting</em>. C. 一坐一食. The next <em>sūtra</em>, which lists the same ascetic practices as found here, has 一處一坐 instead of 一坐一食 for this item, and it includes a brief gloss. This makes better sense given that one of the later items below is taking a single meal, which would seem to duplicate this one. I’ve decided to translate the version in EĀ 12.6. The uncorrected Taisho reading would be “taking a single meal in one sitting” (lit. “one-sitting single meal”). [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
