<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0554a07" target="_blank">T125.2.554a7-b10</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is an expanded explanation of <a href="../02/EA_02_01.html" target="_blank">EĀ 2.1</a>. This pattern holds true for the remainder of the chapter as well. The commentary to the Chinese translation says that EĀ 2.1-10 were taught to intelligent disciples, and EĀ 3.1-10 were taught to dull-witted disciples. It would make sense that this may have happened during the Buddha’s life; i.e., that students who already understood a teaching would need only a reference to it, while new students would require a full explanation. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>become well known … unconditioned state.</em> This passage has been added to the introduction found in Chapter 2. The commentary (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T25n1507_p0037b09" target="_blank">T1507.25.37b9-12</a>) associates these five attainments with rewards in the afterlife: “Well known” (名譽) refers to becoming a noble wheel-turning king, “great reward” (大果報) refers to birth as the god Śakra, “all good and complete attainments” (諸善普至) refers to birth in the Brahma Heaven (presumably as a result of mastering meditation), “the sweet-tasting nectar” (甘露味) refers to becoming a <em>pratyeka buddha</em>, and “the unconditioned state” (無為處) refers to the fruit of the <em>arhat</em>.</p>
<p><em>sweet dew</em>. C. 甘露, S. <em>amṛta</em>, P. <em>amata</em>. The Indic refers to a special liquid or juice that gave the gods their immortality when they consumed it. It was equivalent to the <em>ambrosia</em> that Greek gods ate. In both cases, the words lit. mean “immortality,” (i.e., deathless or undying). C. translators used a native motif about a “sweet dew” thought to bring bounty, peace, and happiness to the land when it fell as rain from heaven. When 甘露 occurs in Chinese Buddhist texts, it describes S. <em>amṛta</em> with a concept familiar to the Chinese audience at the time. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p>Compare this visualization with the description found in <a href="suttacentral.net/an6.10" target="_blank">AN 6.10</a>. While both exercises use the Buddha’s exalted example as an object of practice, the one in AN is an insight meditation, while this description appears to be a <em>samādhi</em> practice. It’s similar to the visualization practices that developed among Mahāyāna Buddhists, e.g. <cite>The Visualization of the Buddha Amitāyus Sūtra</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T12n0365_f001" target="_blank">T365</a>). Perhaps those practices were inspired by existing <em>samādhi</em> practices that visualized an idealized Buddha Śākyamuni. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
