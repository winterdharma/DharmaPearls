After cultivating this one thing, they’ll become well known and achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments.

They then will achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about <em>nirvāṇa</em> themselves. What’s this one thing? It’s called recollecting generosity.”</td>

<li id="n2"><p><em>This is how … well known.</em> C. 是謂，比丘，名曰大施. The Taisho edition appears to be corrupt, for it omits mention of a recollection or becoming well known. Lit., it reads: “This, monks, is called ‘great generosity.’”. I’ve translated the passage assuming that the original followed the format of the other <em>sūtra</em>s in this chapter (i.e., 「是謂，諸比丘，若念施者便有名譽⋯」). [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
