<li id="n2"><p><em>great reward</em>. The C. here reads “great virtue” (大功徳), which is inconsistent with the introduction of the rest of his chapter’s <em>sūtra</em>s. I’ve ignored it as a translation or editing error. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>four pairs and eight ranks</em>. C. 四雙八輩, P. <em>cattāri purisayugāni aṭṭha purisapuggalā</em>. This expression is not explicitly explained in the <cite>Ekottarika Āgama</cite>, but the usual understanding in other early Buddhist sources is this: The four pairs refers to people in the process of entering the stream, and those who have entered it, and so on for once-returners, non-returners, and <em>arhat</em>s. Altogether, they make eight ranked levels of awakening. The expressions “four pairs” and “eight ranks” refer to this same list, counted in different ways (cf. the expanded passage found in <a href="../../dirgha/DA_5.html#p19" target="_blank">DĀ 5</a>).
