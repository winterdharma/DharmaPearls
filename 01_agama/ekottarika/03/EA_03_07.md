After cultivating this one thing, they’ll become well known and achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments. They’ll attain the sweet-tasting dew and arrive at the unconditioned state. They then will achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about <em>nirvāṇa</em> themselves. What’s this one thing? It’s called recollecting peace.”</td>

The Buddha addressed the monks, “How does someone who cultivates the recollection of peace become well known, achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments, attain the sweet-tasting dew, and arrive at the unconditioned state?

<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0555b25" target="_blank">T125.2.555c20-6a14</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is an expanded explanation of <a href="../02/EA_02_07.html" target="_blank">EĀ 2.7</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>rise up to a greater light.</em> C. 勝光上達. This esoteric expression seems to refer to spiritual progress in general. The verb 上達 is used occasionally in other Chinese translations (e.g., at <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T03n0152_p0008a21" target="_blank">T152.3.8a21</a> and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T10n0291_p0603b08" target="_blank">T291.10.603b8</a>) to mean ascending into the sky or up to a heavenly place. This would suggest a “greater light” refers to a heavenly rebirth. In other texts, “greater light” (勝光) is usually associated with heavenly light, such as the luminance created by a god visiting the Buddha at night. Neither term (勝光 or 上達) occurs again in EĀ. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>This is how … well known.</em> C. 如是，諸比丘，名曰念休息。便得具足⋯. The Taisho edition appears to be corrupt, for it omits mention of becoming well known. Lit., it reads: “Thus, monks, this is called ‘recollecting peace.’ Then, attaining its perfection …”. I’ve translated the passage assuming that the original followed the format of the initial <em>sūtra</em>s in this chapter (i.e., 「是謂，諸比丘，若念休息者便有名譽⋯」). [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
