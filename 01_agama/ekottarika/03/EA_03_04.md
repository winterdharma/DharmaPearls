    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should cultivate one thing and disseminate one thing. After cultivating this one thing, they’ll become well known and achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments. They’ll attain the sweet-tasting dew and arrive at the unconditioned state. They then will achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about <em>nirvāṇa</em> themselves. What’s this one thing? It’s called recollecting the precepts.”</td>

The Buddha addressed the monks, “How does someone who cultivates the recollection of the precepts become well known, achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments, attain the sweet-tasting dew, and arrive at the unconditioned state? How do they achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruit of the ascetic, and bring about <em>nirvāṇa</em> themselves?”</td>

    <td>The monks then said to the Bhagavān, “What the Tathāgata says is the source of the teachings. Please, Bhagavān, explain the wonderful meaning of this for the monks. After we hear it from the Tathāgata, the monks will accept and retain it.”</td>

<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0555a05" target="_blank">T125.2.555a5-28</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is an expanded explanation of <a href="../02/EA_02_04.html" target="_blank">EĀ 2.4</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>fortune vase that provides what one wishes</em>. C. 吉祥瓶所願便剋. “Fortune vase” (吉祥瓶) seems to reference a magic container that produces whatever one wants. The commentary gives us more context for this passage (at <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T25n1507_p0038b01" target="_blank">T1507.25.38b</a>): “If one wants to end their bondage and seek awakening, they should focus on that wish. It’s like a fortune vase: Whatever a person wants, they [reach in] and get it” (若欲斷結求道，所願應意。猶吉祥瓶：隨人所欲，取即得之). This reference to a magic container appears again in <a href="../10/EA_10_04.html" target="_blank">EĀ 10.4</a> where it’s a metaphor for benefactors who give whatever is needed. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>This is how … well known.</em> C. 如是，比丘，行禁戒者. The <cite>Taisho</cite> edition appears to be corrupt because it omits mention of a recollection or becoming well known. Lit., it reads: “Thus, monks, someone who practices the precepts achieves a great reward … .” I’ve translated the passage assuming that the original followed the format of the first three <em>sūtra</em>s in this chapter (i.e., 「是謂，諸比丘，若念戒者便有名譽⋯」).
