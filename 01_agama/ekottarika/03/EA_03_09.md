    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should cultivate one thing and disseminate one thing. After cultivating this one thing, they’ll become well known and achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments. They’ll attain the sweet-tasting dew and arrive at the unconditioned state.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> They then will achieve spiritual knowledge, dispel their confused ideas, win the fruits of the ascetic, and bring about <em>nirvāṇa</em> themselves.

The Buddha addressed the monks, “How does someone who cultivates the recollection of the body become well known, achieve a great reward and all good and complete attainments, attain the sweet-tasting dew, and arrive at the unconditioned state?

    <td>The monks then said to the Bhagavān, “What the Tathāgata says is the source of the teachings. Please, Bhagavān, explain the wonderful meaning of this for the monks. After we hear it from the Tathāgata, the monks will accept and retain it.”</td>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0556b15" target="_blank">T125.2.556b15-c12</a>. This <em>sūtra</em> is an expanded explanation of <a href="../02/EA_02_09.html" target="_blank">EĀ 2.9</a>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>the unconditioned state</em>. C. 無為道. The C. here is inconsistent with the other <em>sūtra</em>s in this chapter. I.e., 無為處 (“unconditioned abode”) has been changed to 無為道 (“unconditioned awakening” or “path”). I’ve disregarded this change as a translation or editing error. The expression refers to becoming an <em>arhat</em> according to the commentary (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T25n1507_p0037b11" target="_blank">T1507.25.37b11</a>), so the difference is not that significant, in any case. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>the contents of the stomach</em>. C. 百葉滄蕩脾泡. 百葉 was used to refer to the multi-stage stomachs of animals like cows and sheep. Overall, the passage appears garbled, and later editions rewrote it as 滄腸胃泡 or 倉腸胃脬. The gist of it appears to be the liquid contents of the stomach. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>cerebral fluid</em>. C. 漾髑髏. Lit. “cranial fluid.” [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>This is how … well known.</em> C. 如是，諸比丘，名曰念身。便得具足⋯. The Taisho edition appears to be corrupt, for it omits mention of becoming well known. Lit., it reads: “Thus, monks, is called ‘recollecting the body.’ Then, attaining its perfection …”. I’ve translated the passage assuming that the original followed the format of the initial <em>sūtra</em>s in this chapter (i.e., 「是謂，諸比丘，若念身者便有名譽⋯」). [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
