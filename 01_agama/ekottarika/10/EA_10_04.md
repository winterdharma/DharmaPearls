    <td id='p1'>1. Thus I have heard:<sup id="ref1"><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</td>

    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “What services and gifts should donors and almsgivers provide to diligent noble people who observe the precepts?”</td>

    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564b21'>爾時，諸比丘白世尊曰： 「世尊是諸法之王！ 唯願，世尊，與諸比丘而說此義。 盡當奉持。」</td>
    <td id='p3'>3. The monks then said to the Bhagavān, “The Bhagavān is the king of teachings! Please, Bhagavān, teach the monks about the meaning of this. Once we’ve heard it, the monks will approve of it.”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564b23'>爾時，世尊告諸比丘： 「諦聽！諦聽，善思念之。 我當與汝分別其義。」</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564b26'>世尊告曰： 「檀越、施主承事、供養精進、持戒諸多聞者猶如與迷者指示其路。 糧食乏短而給施食。 恐怖之人令無憂惱。 驚畏者教令莫懼。 無所歸者與作覆護。 盲者作眼目，與病作醫王。</td>
    <td id='p4'>4. The Bhagavān told them, “A donor or almsgiver who renders services and gives offerings to diligent and learned people who observe the precepts is like someone who shows the way to the lost. They’re like someone who provides meals to those in need of food. They’re like someone who puts anxious people at ease. They’re like someone who instructs the fearful to not be afraid. They’re like someone who gives shelter to those without refuge. They’re like someone who serves as eyes for the blind or a king of medicine for the sick.</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564c1'>「猶如田家農夫修治田業。 除去穢草便能成就穀食。 比丘常當除棄五盛陰病，求入無畏泥洹城中。 如是，諸比丘，檀越施主承事、供養精進、持戒諸多聞者當施。」</td>
    <td id='p5'>5. “They’re like a farmer cultivating their land. They remove debris and weeds so that they can harvest their crop. A monk must constantly abandon the illness of the five proliferating aggregates as he seeks to enter the city of <em>nirvāṇa</em> fearlessly. Thus, monks, should a donor or almsgiver be generous when providing services and offerings to diligent and learned people who observe the precepts.”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564c5'>爾時，阿那邠持長者集在彼眾。 爾時，長者阿那邠持白世尊曰： 「如是，世尊！如是，如來！ 一切施主及與受者猶吉祥瓶。 諸受施人如毘沙王。 勸人行施如親父母。 受施之人是後世良祐。 一切施主及與受者猶如居士。」</td>
    <td id='p6'>6. The wealthy man Anāthapiṇḍada<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> was in the audience at the time. He then said to the Bhagavān, “So it is, Bhagavān! So it is, Tathāgata! All donors and their recipients are like auspicious vases. Those who accept their donations are like King Vaiśravaṇa. They encourage people to practice generosity like a friend or parent. A person who accepts donations will have excellent fortune in the next life. All donors and their recipients are like householders.”</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564c10'>世尊告曰： 「如是，長者。 如汝所言。」</td>

    <td id='p7'>7. The wealthy man Anāthapiṇḍada said to the Bhagavān, “From now on, my door won’t be guarded, nor will monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, or travelers be refused who are in need of a meal.”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564c13'>爾時，阿那邠持長者白世尊曰： 「唯願，世尊及比丘眾受弟子請。」</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564c15'>爾時，長者見世尊默然受請，即禮佛三匝還歸所在。 到舍已，即其夜辦具甘饌、種種飯食，廣敷坐具。 自白： 「時到，食具已辦。 唯願，世尊願時臨顧。」</td>
    <td id='p9'>9. Seeing that the Bhagavān had silently accepted his invitation, that wealthy man then bowed to the Buddha, circled him three times, and returned to his home. Arriving at his house, he prepared a variety of sweet delicacies for the evening and arranged for a sitting area. He then sent word, “When you arrive, the meal will be fully prepared. Please let the Bhagavān come when it’s convenient.”</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564c18'>爾時，世尊將諸比丘眾，著衣，持鉢，詣舍衞城，至長者家。 到已，各自就座，諸比丘僧亦各隨次坐。</td>
    <td id='p10'>10. The Bhagavān then led the assembly of monks, putting on his robes and taking his bowl to that wealthy man’s household in Śrāvastī. When they arrived, he prepared his own seat, and the assembly of monks each seated themselves in their order.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564c21'>爾時，長者見佛、比丘眾坐定，手自斟酌行種種飮食。 以行種種飮食，各收鉢坐。 更取卑座，在如來前，欲聽聞法。</td>
    <td id='p11'>11. Seeing that the Buddha and assembly of monks were seated and settled, the wealthy man then served them a variety of foods with his own hands. As he gave out those various meals, they each took a bowl and sat. He then brought out a humble chair and sat in front of the Buddha hoping to hear the Dharma.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.564c23'>爾時，長者白世尊言： 「善哉，如來聽諸比丘隨所須物，三衣、鉢、盂鍼、筒、尼師壇、衣帶、法澡罐、及餘一切沙門雜物。 盡聽弟子家取之。</td>
    <td id='p12'>12. That wealthy man then said to the Bhagavān, “It’d be good if the Tathāgata permitted the monks to have the things that they need, such as three robes, a bowl, needle, tube, sitting mat, filter cloth, water basin, and the rest of an ascetic’s items. Permit them all to get these things from my family.”</td>

    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.565a2'>當於爾時，阿那邠持復於四城門而廣惠施，第五市中，第六在家。 須食與食，須漿與漿。 須車乘、妓樂、香熏、瓔珞悉皆與之。</td>
    <td id='p15'>15. At a later time, Anāthapiṇḍada gave out gifts broadly at each of the city’s four gates, a fifth in the market, and a sixth at his home. He gave food if people needed food and drink if drink was needed. He provided to everyone what carts, music, incense, and jewelry that they needed.</td>

    <td id='p16'>16. The Bhagavān heard about Anāthapiṇḍada giving out gifts broadly at the city’s four gates, that he had also given to the needy in the marketplace, and that he again gave measureless gifts from inside his own home.</td>
