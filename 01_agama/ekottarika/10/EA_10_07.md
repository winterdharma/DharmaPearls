    <td class='ch' title='T125.2.565b24'>爾時，世尊告諸比丘： 「汝等莫畏福報。 所以然者？ 此是受樂之應甚可愛、敬。 所以名為『福』者有此大報。 汝等當畏無福。 所以然者？ 此名苦之原本。 愁、憂、苦、惱不可稱記，無有愛樂，此名『無福』。</td>
    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Don’t be afraid of the rewards of merit. Why is that? It gets pleasures that should be desirable and respectable. The reason it’s called ‘merit’ is that it has great rewards. What you should fear is having no merit. Why is that? That’s the name for the source of suffering. Indescribable sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble and the lack of desirable pleasure is called ‘having no merit.’</td>

    <td id='p3'>3. “Monks, I recall in the past I had practiced kindness for seven years. After that, I didn’t return to this world for seven eons. During those seven eons, I was born in the Ābhāsvara Heaven. I was born in an empty Brahma Heaven as the god Mahābrahmā during those seven eons. I was the unmatched ruler of a hundred thousand worlds. I was reborn thirty-six times as Śakra the Lord of Gods. I also became a noble wheel-turning king countless times.</td>

This is the reason it’s called ‘merit.’ What you should fear is having no merit. Why is that? That’s the source of suffering.
