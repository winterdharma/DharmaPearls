It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If someone accepts one thing and doesn’t part with one thing, then Māra the Wicked One won’t be able to get an advantage over them. He won’t be able to come and harass them, either. What is that one thing? It’s virtuous, meritorious deeds. Why is that?</td>

Deceitful Māra the Wicked One led an army numbering in the hundreds of thousands of millions. His soldiers had all sorts of indescribable forms with animal heads and human bodies. The gods, <em>nāga</em>s, <em>yakṣa</em>s, <em>asura</em>s, <em>garuḍa</em>s, and <em>mahoraga</em>s all came and assembled.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></td>
