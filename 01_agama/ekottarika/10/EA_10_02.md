Having cultivated one thing and disseminated one thing, they’ll then attain spiritual knowledge, pacify their conditioned thinking, attain the fruits of the ascetic, and reach the abode of <em>nirvāṇa</em>. What’s that one thing? It’s the practice of carefulness in the good teachings.</td>

<li id="n2"><p><em>right view … right samādhi</em>. C. 等見⋯等定. The C. lit. reads “equal” rather than “right” in this <em>sūtra</em>. This is likely because of confusion in G. between S. <em>samyak</em> and S. <em>sama</em>, which perhaps led to ambiguous readings in that language. There are also a couple less standard translations of “intention” and “effort,” which are rendered here as “method” (方便) and “discipline” (治). [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
