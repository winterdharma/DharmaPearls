    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks: “When one person appears in the world, the thirty-seven factors of the path appear in the world.

<li id="n2"><p><em>four abodes of mindfulness</em>. C. 四意止, G. <em>cadu spaduvaṭ́hana</em>, S. <em>catvāri smṛty-upasthānāni</em>, P. <em>cattāro satipaṭṭhāna</em>. This is an older C. translation that lit. means four “mental calmings,” or perhaps “mental stops.” [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>four mental abandonments</em>. C. 四意斷, S. <em>catvāri samyakprahāṇāni</em>, P. <em>cattāro sammappadhāna</em>. It would appear that a phonetic change of S. <em>pradhāna</em> (P. <em>padhāna</em>) resulted in the equiv. of S. <em>prahāṇa</em> (G. <em>prahana</em>) being adopted in many Buddhist texts. As a result, early C. translations often interpreted “four right efforts” as “four right abandonments,” as this was the literal meaning of S. <em>prahāṇa</em>. Here, the term 意 has been added by the C. translator to convey the psychological nature of the concept, which involves avoiding bad things and nurturing good ones that arise in one’s mind. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>eight true practices</em>. C. 八真行. This may be an alterate epithet for the eightfold path, perhaps equiv. to S. <em>aṣṭa sucaritāni</em>. <em>Sucarita</em> (“practiced well”) was often translated to C. as “wonderful conduct” (妙行), so it’s conceivable that 真行 could translate this term, too. Elsewhere in EĀ, the noble eightfold path is translated as we would expect (C. 賢聖八品道). [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
