<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>For the source text, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0790a07" target="_blank">T125.2.790a7-1b29</a>. It’s a partial parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn14" target="_blank">DN 14</a>, <a href="../../dirgha/DA_1.html" target="_blank">DĀ 1</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/t2" target="_blank">T2</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/t4" target="_blank">T4</a>. It presents the first half of the <cite>Mahāvadāna Sūtra</cite> (DĀ 1/DN 14), which circulated as an independent <em>sūtra</em>. T4 is also an independent <cite>Seven Buddhas Sūtra</cite> that lacks the legend of Buddha Vipaśyin, while T2 is a fragment that contains part of the Vipaśyin legend.</p>
<p>The general outline and content of this <em>sūtra</em> agrees with its parallels, but the details are sometimes significantly different, and sometimes nearly the same. There is also some textual corruption evident, the most obvious being the repetition of the section on the clans of the seven <em>buddha</em>s. The main departure between this version and the other parallels is that it does not include sections on the parents or sons of each <em>buddha</em>. While the sons section is only found in DĀ 1, T4, and the Sanskrit edition, EĀ 48.4 is the only parallel to not include a section on their parents. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>This version has a detailed introduction that’s very similar to the one in DĀ 1, and which is lacking in DN 14. This includes the apparent reference to the Buddha accessing the <em>dharmadhātu</em> to know about the past <em>buddha</em>s. Here, the synonym <em>dharmasthita</em> may have been translated as <span class="ch">法處</span>. I have translated as I did <span class="ch">法住</span> in <a href="../../samyukta/03/SA3_14.html#p4" target="_blank">SĀ 3.14</a> The practical meaning of these terms is difficult to pin down, but they apparently were an attempt to express the idea of an external truth or natural law that <em>buddha</em>s discern when they awaken. In a passage below, we find <span class="ch">法界</span> serving this purpose instead of <span class="ch">法處</span>. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>Vipaśyin.</em> C. <span class="ch">毘婆尸</span> (EMC. bii-bua-ʃɪi = G. <em>vipaśi</em>), P. <em>vipassī</em>, S. <em>vipaśyin</em>. His name derives from the S. verb <em>vipaśyati</em>, which means “to know, perceive, discern.”</p>
<p><em>Śikhin.</em> C. <span class="ch">式詰</span> (EMC. sɪək-k‘iĕt = G. <em>śikhi</em>), P. <em>sikhī</em>, S. <em>śikhin</em>. The meaning of this name is unclear, but it’s usually interpreted as a kind of hair crest. It’s the name of many things in Sanskrit ranging from a mountain to the fenugreek plant.</p>
<p><em>Viśvabhu.</em> C. <span class="ch">毘舍羅婆</span> (EMC. bii-ʃɪe-la-bua = Pr. <em>viśalava</em> or <em>viśrapa</em>?), G. <em>veṣahu</em>, P. <em>vessabhū</em>, S. <em>viśvabhu</em>. The second half of the C. transliteration doesn’t match any version of S. <em>viśvabhu</em> that I can find, nor does it match the G. attestation of the name. The S. name means “in everything everywhere” and the C. glossary <span class="ch">翻梵語</span> agrees with the gloss <span class="ch">一切有</span> (“everything existing”).</p>
<p><em>Krakucchandha.</em> C. <span class="ch">拘屢孫</span> (EMC. kɪu-lɪu-suən = Pr. <em>kro’sun[dha]</em>?), G. <em>krovasudha</em>, P. <em>kakusandha</em>, S. <em>krakucchandha</em>. This transliteration is closer to BHS. <em>krakutsundha</em> and the G.<em>krovasudha</em> than to the S. attestation. But, here, the second and final consonants are silent. Generally speaking, this name seems to have fallen into obscurity, leading to the various pronunciations that we see in different sources. The glossary <span class="ch">翻梵語</span> claims that it means <span class="ch">領持</span> (“neck holder”). This suggests something like S. <em>kṛka</em> (“neck”) + <em>sandha</em> (“holding”). This might refer to the neck of a stone column rather than a person’s throat. The Tibetan tradition instead interprets his name as meaning “destroyer of <em>saṃsāra</em>” (Edgerton 196), and the C. glossary <span class="ch">一切經音義</span> gives a similar reading of “having ended what ought to be ended” (<span class="ch">所應斷已斷</span>).</p>
<p><em>Kanakamuni.</em> C. <span class="ch">拘那含牟尼</span> (EMC. kɪu-na-ɦəm-mɪəu-nei = Pr. <em>konahamuni</em>), G. <em>konagamuni</em> or <em>konag̱amuni</em>, P. <em>koṇāgamana</em>, S. <em>kanakamuni</em>. Here, the <em>-g-</em> has weakened to an <em>-h-</em> sound (technically, a “pharyngeal voiced fricative”). The S. name lit. means “sage of the Indian rose chestnut tree” or “the golden sage.” The P. name, if we derive it from <em>koṇa</em> + <em>āgamana</em>, might mean “the end of arriving” (i.e., rebirth). His name also seems to have become obscure, leading to divergent readings.</p>
<p><em>Kāśyapa.</em> C. <span class="ch">迦葉</span> (EMC. kă-ʃɪɛp = Pr. <em>kaśap[a]</em>), G. <em>kaśava</em>, P. <em>kassapa </em>, S. <em>kāśyapa</em>. This was a common translit. for Pr. <em>kaśapa</em> (S. <em>kāśyapa</em>) throughout C. translations. Kāśyapa was a well known name of one of the old brahmin clans and an ancient brahmin sage. The name itself may have originally referred to a type of fish or deer.</p>
<p><em>Śākyamuni.</em> C. <span class="ch">釋迦文</span> (EMC. ʃɪɛk-kă-mɪuən = Pr. <em>śakamun[i]</em>), G. <em>śakamuni</em>, P. <em>sakyamunī</em>, S. <em>śākyamuni</em>. The Pali equiv. for this term seems to be a later S. loan word. In DN 14, the Buddha refers to himself simply as “I.” The name itself meant “the sage of the Śākya tribe” and became a common epithet of the Buddha in India. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p>All of the parallels for this passage agree on these details. I’ve chosen to translate <span class="ch">種</span> as tribe here, as I believe there was more than a caste distinction being made in early Buddhist sources when warriors were contrasted with brahmins. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p>This and the next section of this <em>sūtra</em> seem to be a corruption of the original text since they contradict each other. The other parallels are in agreement that the first three <em>buddha</em>s were from the Kauṇḍinya clan, the next three were from the Kāśyapa clan, and the last was from the Gautama clan. Without more information, it’s difficult to explain how we end up with these two accounts in the present text, other than perhaps they were meant to represent both their paternal and maternal clans. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p>All the parallels that include this section are in agreement on the <em>bodhi</em> trees of the six <em>buddha</em>s of the past. For Gautama’s <em>bodhi</em> tree, there are differences in the epithets used for the sacred fig tree, which inject some uncertainty as to whether they all refer to the same type of tree or not. Given the agreement regarding the other trees, though, it’s difficult to doubt that they weren’t in agreement on the Buddha’s <em>bodhi</em> tree. Below are my notes on the trees listed here in this version:</p>
<p><em>patali flower tree.</em> C. <span class="ch">波羅利華樹</span> (EMC. pua-la-lɪi flower tree = G. <em>palaḍi</em> flower tree), P. <em>pāṭali</em>, S. <em>pāṭali </em>. The G. form of this word could be pronounced with an -<em>rd</em>- sound (IPA ɽ), which may explain the C. transliteration. This translit. is also found in SĀ and MĀ (eg. at <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0026_p0802a12" target="_blank">T26.1.802a12</a> and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0099_p0108a04" target="_blank">T99.2.108a4</a>), indicating that <span class="ch">波羅利</span> was a common Pr. reading for S. <em>pāṭali</em>. It may be that the P. reading was borrowed from the S. tradition. This tree (<em>Stereospermum tetragonum</em>) is commonly called the yellow snake or trumpet flower tree.</p>
<p><em>mango tree.</em> C. <span class="ch">分陀利樹</span> (EMC. pɪuən-da-lɪi = G. <em>puṃḍari[ga]</em> tree), P. <em>puṇḍarīka</em>, S. <em>puṇḍarīka</em>. This refers to the Indian mango tree (<em>Mangifera indica</em>), so named for it’s yellow-white flowers. It was native to Northeast India before it was cultivated in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.</p>
<p><em>sal tree.</em> C. <span class="ch">波羅樹</span> (EMC. pua-la tree = Pr. <em>śāla</em>?), G. <em>śala</em>, P. <em>sala</em>, S. <em>śāla</em>. I am assuming that <span class="ch">波</span> is an error for <span class="ch">娑</span> (EMC sa) and that the original reading was S. <em>śāla</em>. Or, perhaps <em>vāla</em> was a variant pronunciation. Either way, I’ve translated it as S. <em>śāla</em> given that this list agrees with the parallels otherwise. Today, this tree is commonly called the sal tree (<em>Shorea robusta</em>). It was a native tree to the Indian subcontinent going back at least 50 million years according to the fossil record. It grows quite large, reaching 130 feet tall.</p>
<p><em>sirisa tree.</em> C. <span class="ch">尸利沙樹</span> (EMC. ʃɪi-lɪi-ṣă = Pr. <em>śiriṣa</em>?), P. <em>sirīsa</em>, S. <em>śirīṣa</em>. This tree (<em>Albizia lebbeck</em>) is still sometimes called the sirisa tree in modern times but also the lebbeck or frywood tree. It has white flowers and long seed pod fruit.</p>
<p><em>cluster fig tree.</em> C. <span class="ch">優頭跋羅樹</span> (EMC. ɪəu-dəu-buat-la tree = Pr. <em>uduṃbara</em> tree), G. <em>uduṃbara</em>, P. <em>udumbara</em>, S. <em>udumbara</em>. This is the cluster fig tree (<em>Ficus racemosa</em>). This tree was widespread throughout tropical Asia including India. It’s a small tree that grows large clusters of figs near its trunk.</p>
<p><em>banyan tree.</em> C. <span class="ch">尼拘留樹</span> (EMC. ṇɪi-kɪu-lɪəu = Pr. <em>nigro[dha]</em> or <em>nigoro[dha]</em>?), G. <em>?</em>, P. <em>nigrodha</em>, S. <em>nigrodha</em>. This is the Indian banyan tree (<em>Ficus benghalensis</em>), which is another variety of fig tree. It’s a large tree well known for its broad canopy and aerial roots. Considered sacred by many Indian traditions, temples are often located near stands of banyan trees.</p>
<p><em>fortune tree.</em> C. <span class="ch">吉祥樹</span>. This last tree’s name is translated into Chinese as <span class="ch">吉祥</span> (“good fortune, auspicious”). This must have been a gloss of the <em>bodhi</em> tree’s name. In any case, it’s difficult to imagine that this was not intended to mean the sacred fig tree (<em>Ficus religiosa</em>). This is another large tree that reaches a hundred feet in height with a trunk up to ten feet in diameter. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p>These figures for the congregations of each <em>buddha</em> are somewhat different than the other parallels. First, Vipaśyin, Śikhin, and Viśvabhu have one congregation each, while they have two or three congregations in the other versions. The numbers for these congregations still decrease by ten or twenty thousand each, which results in higher numbers for the last three of the past <em>buddha</em>s: eighty to sixty thousand rather than forty to twenty thousand.</p>
<p>One curiosity, however, is that this version agrees with DĀ 1 in that Vipaśyin had a congregation of 168,000, where the other versions all have smaller figures (except DN 14, which has corrupted the figure to 6.2 million).</p>
<p>Judging by a pattern across several parallels, it would seem that the original figure was 62 or 68,000 for Vipaśyin. A congregation of 62,000 is cited in five different passages across the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya (T1443.23.915c19, T1448.24.83c16, T1450.24.187b18, T1451.24.215c26, 260c18, 278b27), as well as a passage that cites 80,000 and another that cites 84,000 (T1448.24.96a18 and 48b13, respectively). The 62,000 figure agrees with T2. The Sanskrit parallel has apparently corrupted 62,000 to 6.2 million in the same way that DN 14 has inflated its own figure. My overall impression is that he probably had a single smaller congregation in the earliest stories, which has been enlarged for the <em>Mahāvadāna Sūtra</em> by increasing the number beyond 100,000, adding more congregations, or both.</p>
<p>This evidence regarding Vipaśyin’s congregation suggests that the first three past <em>buddha</em>s probably had only one congregation each initially, as we find here in EĀ 48.4, but their numbers have been increased. This still leaves this version closer to the early stories than the other parallels in this regard. [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p>This list of attendant disciples is significantly different from the lists found in the other parallels. The other parallels generally agree with each other, however, leaving us with a situation that’s difficult to explain. It could be that this section was added independently, causing the names to be chosen differently or placed in a different order. This isn’t implausible to me given that the parallels don’t share all the same details about the seven <em>buddha</em>s. The <em>sūtra</em> seems to have grown as more details were added over time, which is represented in the extant versions.</p>
<p>One thing that is interesting, though, is that all the other parallels begin with Aśoka as the name of Vipaśyin’s attendant. Taken at face value, this would seem to indicate that they date back to the reign of King Aśoka (268-232 BCE) or the period immediately after, when he became famous as a benefactor of the Saṅgha in India. His name does not occur here, but there a couple names shared with the other parallels (i.e., Subuddhi and Svastika).</p>
<p>In any case, my notes on each name is listed below. For the most part, they’ve been translated to C., which makes determining exact S. equivalents uncertain when there are multiple possibilities of similar meaning. I’ve listed the names found in DN 14 and the Sanskrit edition for comparison.</p>
<p><em>*Mahānāyaka.</em> C. <span class="ch">大導師</span>, P. <em>asoka</em>, S. <em>aśoka</em>. This name means “great guide” or “leader.” Another possible S. equivalent is <em>*mahasārthavāha</em>, which would mean “great caravan leader,” referring to the leader of a long distance trade caravan.</p>
<p><em>*Subuddhi.</em> C. <span class="ch">善覺</span>, P. <em>khemaṅkara</em>, S. <em>kṣemakāra</em>. This name lit. means “good perception” or “realization.” The same name occurs in DĀ 1 as Krakucchanda’s attendant.</p>
<p><em>*Ajitasena.</em> C. <span class="ch">勝眾</span>, P. <em>upasanta</em>, S. <em>upaśānta</em>. The C. lit. means “victorious assembly.” S. <em>ajitasena</em> lit. means “unconquered army” and is an attested name for a householder in S. sources (Edgerton 7). There are other possibilities, but they are as speculative as this one.</p>
<p><em>*Svastika.</em> C. <span class="ch">吉祥</span>, P. <em>buddhija</em>, S. <em>bhadrika</em>. The C. lit. means “good fortune, auspicious,” which matches the basic meaning of S. <em>svastika</em> (P. <em>sotthika</em>). This name is attested in the Sanskrit parallel for Kanakamuni’s attendant.</p>
<p><em>*Vīrasena.</em> C. <span class="ch">毘羅先</span> (EMC. bii-la-sen = Pr. <em>virasen[a]</em>?), P. <em>sotthija</em>, S. <em>svastika</em>. This is the only straightforward S. equiv. for the C. transliteration that I have found to be attested as a personal name (cf. Edgerton 506). It lit. means “having an army of heroes.”</p>
<p><em>*Nāyaka.</em> C. <span class="ch">導師</span>, P. <em>sabbamitta</em>, S. <em>sarvamitra</em>. This name is the same as the first, minus the “great” (P/S. <em>mahā-</em>). It means “guide, leader.”</p>
<p><em>Ānanda.</em> C. <span class="ch">阿難</span> (EMC. •a-nan = Pr. <em>anan[da]</em>), P. <em>ānanda</em>, S. <em>ānanda</em>. This name lit. means “happiness, delight, joy.” [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n9"><p>All of the parallels are in agreement that the life spans of the <em>buddha</em>s ranged from 80,000 years to 20,000, decreasing by 10,000 years each. This version, however, differs from the othe parallels in that it skips 30,000 years rather than 50,000. It also cites 84,000 years as Vipaśyin’s life span instead of 80,000. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n10"><p>This conclusion is unique to this version of the <em>sūtra</em>, which seems to be a brief commentary acknowledging the existence of many more past and future <em>buddha</em>s than seven. The lineage of seven <em>buddha</em>s described here is reminescent of the histories of tribal peoples that often go back a certain number of generations. The Buddha (or Buddhist commentator) here says that every <em>buddha</em> traces his lineage back through the six previous <em>buddha</em>s, even though there are actually many more that have existed.
