Why is that? They are your standard; they are your measure. The Bhagavān accepted the realization of these disciples, the elder Citra and youth Hastaka.’ If that young man wants to cut off his hair and beard, put on the three Dharma robes, leave home, and train on the path, he should be like the monks Śāriputra or Maudgalyāyana. Why is that? Then, the monks Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana would be his standard; they would be his measure.</td>

    <td>“Love training in the correct Dharma, don’t do wrong deeds, and don’t be roused by what’s not Dharma. If you produce defiled ideas here, then you’ll fall into the three bad destinies. When you’re mindful and focused, you’ll attain what you haven’t attained, acquire what you haven’t acquired, and realize in the present what you have yet to realize. Why is that? Monks, the honor of a faithful gift that can’t actually be digested will prevent a person from attaining awakening.</td>
