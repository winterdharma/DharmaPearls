The Chinese transliterates the Indic word that was equivalent to English “Hell” as a place of punishment in the afterlife. <em>Naraka</em> literally means a pit, so a literal translation to English could be “the Pit.” The next occurrence of “Hell,” however, translates the Indic name to Chinese as 地獄 (lit. “earth prison”).
