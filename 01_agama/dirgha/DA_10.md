2\. On the fifteenth-day full moon, the Bhagavān sat in an open area with a great assembly surrounding him. After teaching the Dharma all night, he addressed Śāriputra, “The monks have gathered today from the four directions.

What are the five? [1] If a monk hears the Buddha teach Dharma, hears a teaching by a religious practitioner, or hears a teaching by a senior teacher, he considers, investigates, and discerns the teaching and its meaning, and his heart rejoices. Once he rejoices, he gains a love of Dharma. Once he gains a love of Dharma, his body and mind become peaceful. Once his body and mind are peaceful, he attains <em>samādhi</em>. Once he attains <em>samādhi</em>, he attains true knowledge. This is the first entry to liberation.

Escaping and being free of desires, the arising of contaminants caused by those desires is also entirely abandoned and ceased, and he becomes liberated.

Don’t misrepresent the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata doesn’t say, “I’d like to cultivate the liberation of kindness, but then notions of anger arise.” That’s impossible.

102\. “If a diligent monk has somewhere to go, he thinks, ‘I will be traveling tomorrow, which will interrupt my practice.

104\. “If a diligent monk recovers a little from an illness, he thinks, ‘I’ve begun to recover from that illness. It might get worse, which would interrupt my practice. I ought to make effort by sitting in meditation and walking back and forth now.’ He will attain what he has yet to attain, obtain what he has yet to obtain, and realize what he has yet to realize. Thereupon, that monk then immediately makes effort by sitting in meditation and walking. [This is the eighth effort.]

105\. “What are eight things that are difficult to understand? The eight cases of having no opportunity to cultivate the religious practice. What are the eight? [1] The Tathāgata, the Arhat, arises in the world and teaches the sublime teaching that’s quiescent, unconditioned, and leads to the path of awakening. A person who’s born in hell has no opportunity there to cultivate the religious practice.

106\. “[2] The Tathāgata, the Arhat, arises in the world and teaches the sublime teaching that’s quiescent, unconditioned, and leads to the path of awakening. There are sentient beings born among animals … [3] among hungry ghosts … [4] among long-lived gods … [5] in border lands where they are unaware of it. The Buddha’s teaching doesn’t exist in such places, so there’s no opportunity to cultivate the religious practice.

109\. “[8] The Tathāgata, the Arhat, doesn’t arise in the world, and no one teaches the sublime teaching that’s quiescent, unconditioned, and leads to the path of awakening. Some sentient beings are born in a central country, and their faculties are complete. They are worthy of the noble teaching, but they don’t meet a buddha, so they can’t cultivate the religious practice. This is the eighth case of having no opportunity.

110\. “What are eight things to produce? The eight awakenings of the great person: The path should have few desires; having many desires is not the path. The path should be satisfying; being unsatisfied is not the path. The path should be secluded; enjoying company is not the path. The path should be to restrain oneself; playing around is not the path. The path should be diligent; indolence is not the path. The path should be focused attention; forgetfulness is not the path.

Observing external form without an internal perception of form is the second liberation. The liberation of purity is the third liberation. Going beyond notions of form, ceasing notions of anger, and abiding in the abode of space is the fourth liberation. Going beyond the abode of space and abiding in the abode of awareness is the fifth liberation. Going beyond the abode of awareness and abiding in the abode of nothingness is the sixth liberation.

### Notes

1. {:#n1}This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 10 of the <cite>Dīrgha Āgama</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0001_p0052c17" target="_blank">T1.1.52c17-7b24</a>). The direct parallels to this sūtra include <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn34" target="_blank">DN 34</a>, <a href="DA_9.html" target="_blank">DĀ 9</a>, and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T0013_001" target="_blank">T13</a>. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2}*Gargarā*. C. 伽伽 (MC. g’ia-g’ia), P. Gaggarā, S. Gargarā, BHS Gargā. The Chinese transliteration appears to be old Pkt. \*Gaggā, which in BHS became Gargā, and in S. Gargarā, which begs the question whether P. Gaggarā was a translation from S. I’ve adopted the S. attestation. [\[back\]](#ref2)
3. {:#n3}Śāriputra’s opening statement is a gāthā in both DN 34 and an extant S. edition of this sūtra, but it’s in prose both here and in the older Chinese translation by Anshigao. [\[back\]](#ref3)
4. {:#n4}*Constant mindfulness of oneself*. C. 常自念身, P. kāyagatā sati sātasahagatā, S. kāyagatā smrtiḥ. The Chinese might also be read “Constant mindfulness of one’s body.” [\[back\]](#ref4)
5. {:#n5}*Contemplation of the foul discharges*. C. 惡露觀. This is synonymous with the contemplation of foulness (P. asubha bhāvana) according to a passage in the *Dharmaguptaka Vinaya* (T1428.582a4-6). [\[back\]](#ref5)
6. {:#n6}*central country*. I.e., a civilized region rather than a frontier region that’s barbaric. The conditions in lawless regions in the ancient world was not conducive to practicing. In India, a central country would be places like Śrāvastī and Magadha. [\[back\]](#ref6)
7. {:#n7}This list differs from that found in Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda parallels. There is a lengthy commentary on this version of the seven concepts found in the *Śāriputra Abhidharma* (cf. T1548.638b9ff). [\[back\]](#ref7)
8. {:#n8}*Changes to the senses*. C. 除入, P. abhibhāyatanāni, S. abhibhvāyatanāni. On the face of it, the Chinese appears to mean “eliminated” or “removed,” as these are the most common readings for 除. In Pali and Sanskrit sources, the term is interpreted as P. abhibhā, or “mastery,” and this is confirmed by later Chinese translations of Sanskrit Abhidharma. Interestingly, an equivalent reading (除處) is found in MĀ 215 (T26.799c25) for these eight perceptions. However, the *Śāriputra Abhidharma* (cf. T1548.642a19ff.) calls the list 勝入 (“overcoming the senses”), so both readings existed in translations of pre-Sanskrit texts. Given this situation, it’s important to note that 除 has less frequent readings in classical Chinese as “to govern, fix, correct” and “to change, turn over (e.g., a new year).” They may be closer to the intended meaning in these older translations than the usual readings. I’ve translated the term accordingly. [\[back\]](#ref8)
9. {:#n9}The *Śāriputra Abhidharma* (T1548.639b16ff.) describes the oppressive fear that arises when one’s death is imminent to explain the concept of the pain of impermanence. Thus, it’s the unpleasant feelings one has when facing one’s mortality. [\[back\]](#ref9)
10. {:#n10}The *Śāriputra Abhidharma* (T1548.639c2ff.) describes the lack of tranquility and right liberation that results from supposing that the awareness, body, and external things are oneself or belong to oneself. [\[back\]](#ref10)
11. {:#n11}This list occurs in the *Śāriputra Abhidharma* (T1548.654c27) without elaboration. I’ve corrected the reading of the first item by adopting an alternate reading that agrees with the Abhidharma passage and deleted the repetition at the end. It would appear that a well-meaning editor didn’t understand that the items were being counted rather than the statements and revised the list to create a ninth statement. [\[back\]](#ref11)
12. {:#n12}*formations*. C. 集. The parallel in T1548 has 覺 instead, which suggests S. *vitarka* or *saṃkalpa* in the Indic original. The meaning in that case would be along the lines of perception, idea, or awareness. [\[back\]](#ref12)
13. {:#n13}*Patience*. C. 含受, P. khama. The same passage in DĀ 11 reads 堪忍 instead, which agrees with the Pali parallel. 含受 is unclear in meaning. Perhaps the 堪忍 in DĀ 11 was an improved translation that didn’t replace this earlier attempt. [\[back\]](#ref13)
14. {:#n14}The items in this list are discussed in the *Śāriputra Abhidharma* (T1548.588b23 ff). [\[back\]](#ref14)
15. {:#n15}*guards*. C. 捨, P. rakkha. It would seem 捨 is a mistake for 護, which would be understandable if a copyist thought the intended meaning was equanimity, given that these two terms were both common translations of S. upekṣa. However, various Abhidharma definitions, including the one found in the *Śāriputra Abhidharma*, agree that the meaning is to guard one thing. I’ve translated accordingly. [\[back\]](#ref15)
