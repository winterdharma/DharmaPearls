<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 12 of the <cite>Dīrgha Āgama</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0001_p0059b14" target="_blank">T1.1.57b25-60a27</a>). It does not appear to have an extant parallel. The basic concept behind the three categories is similar to the rubric found in EBTs like <a href="../samyukta/13/SA13_75.html" target="_blank">SĀ 13.75 (785)</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ma189" target="_blank">MĀ 189</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn117" target="_blank">MN 117</a>. These texts divide the “right path” into mundane and supermundane types, which we will see here as well when the eightfold path is listed. This same principle is expressed in terms of rebirth throughout this <em>sūtra</em>. I.e., the mundane good leads to birth in a good destination, while the supermundane good brings an end to rebirth (<em>nirvāṇa</em>). [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>bad destinies … good destinies.</em> C. <span class="ch">惡趣</span> … <span class="ch">善趣</span>, P. <em>duggati … sugati</em>, S. <em>durgati … sugati</em>. Bad destinies refers to rebirth in Hell, among animals, or hungry ghosts. Good destinies refers to rebirth as humans on Earth or gods in the heavens. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>calmness … contemplation.</em> C. <span class="ch">止</span> … <span class="ch">觀</span>, P. <em>samatha … vipassanā</em>, S. <em>śamatha … vipaśyanā</em>. These were two categories of meditative practices. Calming meditation had the goal of pacifying the mind, emotions, and body, while contemplation meditation consisted of analytical or contemplative exercises. However, while meditative practices could be categorized into one or the other way, they are generally considered complementary to each other and practiced together. One might practice a calming exercise to get into the frame of mind needed for a contemplative exercise. Here, we see the two treated as separate categories. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p>For more about these three types of <em>samādhi</em>, see the notes to <a href="DA_9.html#n4" target="_blank">DĀ 9</a> on the subject. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>adultery</em>. C. <span class="ch">婬逸</span>. The C. term here literally means sexual copulation, but I assume the five precepts refer to those observed by laypeople, which do not prohibit sex between a married couple. However, if these precepts had renunciates in mind, then it would mean any kind of sexual act because they were expected to be celibate. This is also true for the passages below that list engaging in sex as a precept. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p><em>these nine good things</em>. C. <span class="ch">九善法</span>. This list also occurs in <a href="DA_10.html#p123" target="_blank">DĀ 10</a> and <a href="DA_11.html#p57" target="_blank">DĀ 11</a>, but there it’s called the nine sources of joy (<span class="ch">九喜本</span>). This list, however, doesn’t occur in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn34" target="_blank">DN 34</a>. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
