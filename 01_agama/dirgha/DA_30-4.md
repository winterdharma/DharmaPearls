#### Chapter 4: The Hells
##### The Eight Great Hells

1\. The Buddha told the monks,[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} “There are 8,000 islands that surround the four continents. There’s also a great ocean that completely encircles those 8,000 islands, and a chain of great diamond mountains encircles that ocean. Beyond those diamond mountains, there’s a second chain of great diamond mountains. There’s an utter darkness between those two mountain chains, where the great illuminating power of the sun and moon gods doesn’t reach.

4\. “What is called the \*Saṃjñā Hell? In that hell, sentient beings grow iron claws on their hands that are long and sharp. They are quick to anger, harboring resentments and harmful notions. When they seize each other with their claws, flesh falls from their hands. After they perceive their own deaths, a cool breeze blows over them and restores their skin and flesh. Quickly healed, they stand back up and perceive of themselves, ‘I’m alive again!’ The other sentient beings say, ‘I perceive that you are alive!’ Because of these perceptions, it’s called the \*Saṃjñā Hell.
{:#p4}

5\. “Furthermore, the sentient beings in the \*Saṃjñā Hell harbor harmful notions and attack each other. They hold spontaneous swords in their hands, and those swords have sharp points. They hack and stab each other, slicing and chopping their bodies to bits on the ground. They perceive, ‘I’m dead,’ and then a cool breeze blows over them that restores their skin and flesh. Quickly healed, they stand back up and perceive of themselves, ‘I’m alive again!’ The other sentient beings say, ‘I perceive that you are alive!’ Because of these circumstances, it’s called the \*Saṃjñā Hell.

{:#p9}

10\. “A fierce and hot wind rises there that blows hot black sand. It sticks to the sentient beings and makes their whole bodies black as a dark cloud.

No part of them isn’t covered by it. They’re made to feel around, pick it up, and put it into their mouths, which burns their tongue and gums. From their throat, it continues to their stomach and passes down through them. No part of them isn’t burned by it. There are iron fanged serpents that bite them, too.

Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Tapana Hell.
{:#p80}

81\. “Furthermore, the wardens of the Tapana Hell lead the sinner into an iron chamber. That chamber is in flames, glowing red inside and out. It burns and roasts the sinner, and their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Tapana Hell.
{:#p81}

82\. “Furthermore, the wardens of the Tapana Hell take the sinner and put them up in an iron tower. That tower is in flames, glowing red inside and out. It burns and roasts the sinner, and their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Tapana Hell.
{:#p82}

83\. “Furthermore, the wardens of the Tapana Hell take the sinner and throw them into a large iron kiln. That kiln is in flames, glowing red inside and out. It burns and roasts the sinner, and their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Tapana Hell.
{:#p83}

84\. “Furthermore, the wardens of the Tapana Hell take the sinner and throw them onto a huge frying pan. That frying pan is in flames, glowing red inside and out. It burns and roasts the sinner, and their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. [Therefore, it’s called the Tapana Hell.]
{:#p84}

85\. “After experiencing these pains for a long time, they escape the Tapana Hell. They run in confusion trying to save themselves from the prison of their past misdeeds, but they inadvertently arrive at the Black Sand Hell … the Frozen Ice Hell … afterward their life ends as before.”
{:#p85}

##### The Great Hell of Mahātapana

86\. The Buddha told the monks, “The Great Hell of Mahātapana has sixteen lesser hells that encircle it. Each of them is 500 yojanas across.
{:#p86}

87\. “Why is it called the Mahātapana Hell? The wardens there lead the sinner into an iron city. That city is in flames, glowing red inside and out. It burns the sinner with an even more intense roasting fire. Their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Mahātapana Hell.
{:#p87}

88\. “Furthermore, the wardens of the Mahātapana Hell lead the sinner into an iron chamber. That chamber is in flames, glowing red inside and out. It burns the sinner with an even more intense roasting fire. Their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries.

Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Mahātapana Hell.
{:#p89}

90\. “Furthermore, the wardens of the Mahātapana Hell take the sinner and throw them into a large iron kiln. That kiln is in flames, glowing red inside and out. It burns the sinner with an even more intense roasting fire. Their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Mahātapana Hell.
{:#p90}

91\. “Furthermore, the Mahātapana Hell has a large spontaneous fire pit. The fire rages and blazes. There’s a pair of large fire mounds on two sides of that pit. The wardens there grab the sinner, skewer them on iron forks, and plant them in the fire. It burns their bodies with an even more intense roasting fire. Their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. [Therefore, it’s called the Mahātapana Hell.]
{:#p91}

92\. “After experiencing these pains for a long time, they escape the Mahātapana Hell. They run in confusion trying to save themselves from the prison of their past misdeeds, but they inadvertently arrive at the Black Sand Hell … the Frozen Ice Hell … afterward their life ends as before.”
{:#p92}

##### The Great Hell Avīci

93\. The Buddha told the monks, “The Great Hell of Avīci has sixteen lesser hells that encircle it. Each of them is 500 yojanas across.
{:#p93}

94\. “Why is it called the Avīci Hell? The wardens there grab the sinner and skin them from head to foot. They then wrap the sinner in their own skin and tie them to a flaming cartwheel. That burning cart has swift horses, and the sinner is rolled over a hot iron ground. Turning round and round, their body is pulverized and roasted until their skin and flesh falls off. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Avīci Hell.
{:#p94}

95\. “Furthermore, the Great Hell of Avīci has a great iron city. That city has great fires that rise from all four sides. The eastern flames go west. The western flames go east. The southern flames go north. The northern flames go south. The flames from above go down. The flames from below go up. These blazing flames swirl around, leaving no empty space between them. In the midst of this, the sinner runs east or west, and their body is burned. Their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Avīci Hell.
{:#p95}

96\. “Furthermore, there’s an iron city in the Great Hell of Avīci that’s blazing and glowing hot. In the midst of it, the sinner’s body burns brightly. Their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Avīci Hell.
{:#p96}

97\. “Furthermore, after the sinners have been in the Great Hell of Avīci for a long time, the gates open. They run for it, trying to escape to somewhere else. As they run, their limbs and tendons burst into flames. It’s like a strong man running with a large grass torch in hand that burns brightly in the wind. The sinner is likewise as they run. When they are about to reach the gate, it spontaneously closes, and the sinner is forced to run on hot iron, which burns their bodies. Their skin and flesh are burned to a crisp. The pain is so bitter and extreme as they’re subjected to a multitude of injuries. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die. Therefore, it’s called the Avīci Hell.
{:#p97}

98\. “Furthermore, when the sinners in the Avīci Hell lift their gaze, all they see are ugly forms. Their ears only hear ugly sounds. Their noses only smell bad odors. Their bodies only feel painful contacts. Their minds only remember ugly things. Moreover, there’s not a finger snap of time that they aren’t in pain. Therefore, it’s called the Avīci Hell.
{:#p98}

99\. “After experiencing these pains for a long time, they escape the Avīci Hell. They run in confusion trying to save themselves from the prison of their past misdeeds, but they inadvertently arrive at the Black Sand Hell … the Frozen Ice Hell … afterward their life ends as before.”
{:#p99}

##### Conclusion to the Great Hells

100\. At that point, the Bhagavān spoke in verse:
{:#p100}

And unskillful verbal and mental deeds,\\

##### The Great Vajra Mountains Protect the World

101\. The Buddha told the monks, “There’s a great wind that blows between those two chains of great diamond mountains, which is called Sāṃkhya. If this wind were to reach the four continents and 8,000 islands, it would blow the Earth with its named mountains and Sumeru the mountain king five kilometers off the ground. They might well soar fifty kilometers into the sky, and they would all be reduced to dust. Like a handful of fine chaff thrown into the air by a strong man, that great wind would likewise blow the Earth away. Those two great diamond mountain chains block this wind, preventing it from coming. Monks, you should know that those diamond mountains benefit many people. They came about as a result of the conduct of sentient beings.
{:#p101}

102\. “Moreover, the wind between those two mountain chains is blazing and intensely hot. If that wind were to reach the four continents, the sentient beings, mountains, streams, rivers, seas, plants, trees, and forests there would be scorched and wither. As when moisture leaves the plants during the height of summer and they quickly turn brown and wither, that wind would be the same. If it reached this world, the hot air would bake it in the same way. Those two diamond mountain chains block this wind, preventing it from coming. Monks, you should know that those diamond mountains benefit many people. They came about as a result of the conduct of sentient beings.
{:#p102}

103\. “Moreover, the wind between those two mountain chains is foul smelling, impure, rank, and terrible. If it were to reach this world, it would stink up the sentient beings here, and they would go blind. Those two diamond mountain chains block this wind, preventing it from coming. Monks, you should know that those diamond mountains benefit many people. They came about as a result of the conduct of sentient beings.
{:#p103}

##### Another Ten Hells

104\. “Moreover, there’s another ten hells between those two mountains chains: First is \*Abhra, second is \*Nirabhra, third is \*Ahaha, fourth is Why, fifth is Sheep Bleating, sixth is Sugandhika, seventh is Utpala, eighth is Kumuda, ninth is Puṇḍarīka, and tenth is Padma.
{:#p104}

105\. “What’s the \*Abhra Hell? Sinners in that hell are spontaneously born with bodies like thick clouds, so it’s called \*Abhra.
{:#p105}

106\. “What’s called the \*Nirabhra [Hell]? Punished sentient beings in that hell are spontaneously born with bodies like strips of meat, so it’s called \*Nirabhra.
{:#p106}

107\. “What’s called the \*Ahaha [Hell]? Punished sentient beings in that hell suffer pain from cuts to their bodies. They all say, ‘Ah! Ah!’ so it’s called \*Ahaha.
{:#p107}

108\. “What’s called the Why [Hell]? Punished sentient beings in that hell suffer bitter pain from cuts and have no refuge from it. They all say, ‘Why?’ so it’s called Why.
{:#p108}

109\. “What’s called the Sheep Bleating [Hell]? Punished sentient beings in that hell suffer the pain of cuts to their bodies. They want to raise their voices and speak, but they can’t move their tongues. They sound like sheep bleating, so it’s called Sheep Bleating.
{:#p109}

110\. “What’s called the Sugandhika [Hell]? In that hell, the whole hell is black like the color of a sugandhika flower, so it’s called Sugandhika.
{:#p110}

111\. “What’s called the Utpala Hell? In that hell, the whole hell is blue like an utpala flower, so it’s called Utpala.
{:#p111}

112\. “What’s called the Kumuda [Hell]? In that hell, the whole hell is crimson like the color of a kumuda flower, so it’s called Kumuda.
{:#p112}

113\. “What’s called the Puṇḍarīka [Hell]? In that hell, the whole hell is white like the color of a puṇḍarīka flower, so it’s called Puṇḍarīka.
{:#p113}

114\. “What’s called the Padma [Hell]? In that hell, the whole hell is red like the color of a padma flower, so it’s called Padma.”
{:#p114}

##### The Passage of Time in the Ten Hells

115\. The Buddha told the monks, “Take for example a sixty-four bushel grain bin filled up with sesame seeds. A person takes one seed from it every hundred years until it’s empty. In the \*Abhra Hell, their punishment wouldn’t be done yet. Similarly, twenty lifetimes in the \*Abhra Hell is equal to one lifetime in the \*Nirabhra Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the \*Nirabhra Hell is equal to one lifetime in the \*Ahaha Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the \*Ahaha Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Why Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Why Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Sheep Bleating Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Sheep Bleating Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Sugandhika Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Sugandhika Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Utpala Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Utpala Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Kumuda Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Kumuda Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Puṇḍarīka Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Puṇḍarīka Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Padma Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Padma Hell is equivalent to one medium eon. Twenty medium eons is called a great eon.
{:#p115}

##### The Monk Kokālika’s Fate

116\. “In the Padma Hell, the fire is bright, hot, and blazing. Even if the sinner moves a hundred yojanas away from the fire, they’d still be burned by it. From sixty yojanas away, their ears are deafened, and they hear nothing. From fifty yojanas away, both their eyes are blinded, and they don’t see anything.
{:#p116}

117\. “The monk Kokālika who had harbored bad intent and slandered Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana fell to the Padma Hell after his body broke up and his life ended.
{:#p117}

118\. “At the time, the Brahma King spoke in verse:
{:#p118}

* {:.verse}“‘A man was born\\
With a hatchet in his mouth\\
That he used to chop people\\
With his harsh speech.

* {:.verse}He praised the blameworthy\\
And criticized the praiseworthy.\\
He did bad verbal deeds\\
But was punished physically.

* {:.verse}He was skilled in getting profit;\\
The fault of that was small.\\
When he slandered noble people,\\
His punishment was severe.

* {:.verse}A hundred thousand lives in the \*Nirabhra Hell\\
And forty-one lives in the \*Abhra Hell,\\
That’s the disaster of slandering noble people,\\
Which resulted from his bad intent and words.’”

119\. The Buddha told the monks, “That Brahma King spoke such verses, which were true words approved by the Buddha. Why is that? Now, I am a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One who also says about him:
{:#p119}

* {:.verse}“‘A man was born\\
With a hatchet in his mouth\\
That he used to chop people\\
With his harsh speech.

* {:.verse}He praised the blameworthy\\
And criticized the praiseworthy.\\
He did bad verbal deeds\\
But was punished physically.

* {:.verse}He was skilled in getting profit;\\
The fault of that was small.\\
When he slandered noble people,\\
His punishment was severe.

* {:.verse}A hundred thousand lives in the \*Nirabhra Hell\\
And forty-one lives in the \*Abhra Hell,\\
That’s the disaster of slandering noble people,\\
Which resulted from his bad intent and words.’”

##### King Yama

120\. The Buddha told the monks, “King Yama’s palace is inside the great diamond mountain south of Jambudvīpa. That king rules an area that’s 6,000 yojanas across. His city has seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees … and countless birds sing to each other peacefully <em>as before</em>.
{:#p120}

121\. “Every three days and nights, a large copper cauldron spontaneously appears in front of that King Yama. If the cauldron appears inside his palace, the King is frightened when he sees it and leaves his palace. If the cauldron appears outside his palace, the king is frightened when he sees it and goes inside his palace.
{:#p121}

122\. “A great warden of hell then grabs King Yama and lays him down on hot iron. The warden forces his mouth open with iron forceps and pours molten copper into it. It burns his gums and tongue. From his throat to his stomach, it burns down through him. No part of him isn’t burned to a crisp. After this punishment is done, he rejoins his maidens, and they entertain each other. His great ministers likewise receive the same fortunes.”
{:#p122}

##### The Three Heavenly Messengers

123\. The Buddha told the monks, “There are three [heavenly] messengers.[\[4\]](#n4){:#ref4} What are the three? The first is old age, the second is illness, and the third is death. There are sentient beings whose physical conduct is bad, whose verbal conduct is bad, and whose mental intent is bad. When their bodies break up and their lives end, they fall to hell.
{:#p123}

124\. “The wardens of hell bring these sinners to King Yama. Upon arriving, the wardens tell the King, ‘This one was summoned by the heavenly messengers. Please, great king, question them well about their account.’
{:#p124}

125\. “The King asks the sinner, ‘Didn’t you see the first [heavenly] messenger?’
{:#p125}

“The sinner responds, ‘I didn’t.’

126\. “The king again says, ‘While you were among humans, didn’t you see old people with white hair and teeth fallen out? Whose eyes were cataracted, whose skin was loose and wrinkled? Who used canes and groaned as they walked? Whose bodies trembled and were weak? Didn’t you see those people?’
{:#p126}

“The sinner says, ‘I saw them.’

127\. “The king again says, ‘Didn’t you think to yourself, “I’ll be that way, too!”?’
{:#p127}

“That person responds, ‘I was being careless at the time and didn’t realize that about myself.’

128\. “The king again says to them, ‘You were careless with yourself. You couldn’t cultivate your body, speech, and mind or mend your evil ways and follow good ones. Now, you’ll be made to recognize the pain of your carelessness!’
{:#p128}

129\. “The king also tells them, ‘Now, you’ll get your punishment. It wasn’t your parents’ mistake, not your brothers’ mistake, not the Lord of Gods or your previous ancestors’ mistake, not your associates’, employees’, or servants’ mistake, nor was it the mistake of ascetics or priests. It was your own evil, and now you’ll get what’s coming to you.’
{:#p129}

130\. “Having questioned the sinner about the first heavenly messenger, King Yama then asks them about the second heavenly messenger. ‘Didn’t you see the second heavenly messenger?’
{:#p130}

“‘I didn’t.’

131\. “The king again asks, ‘While you were human before, didn’t you see people who were sick and gaunt, laying with blankets in their own excrement and urine and smelling foul? Who couldn’t leave their home and needed someone to give them food and drink? Whose every joint was painful and sore? Who were crying and moaning, unable to speak? Didn’t you see them?’
{:#p131}

“They answer, ‘I saw them.’

132\. “The king replied, ‘Well, didn’t you think to yourself, “These pains of illness will happen to me, too!”?’
{:#p132}

“The sinner responds, ‘I was being careless at the time and didn’t realize that about myself.’

133\. “The king again says, ‘You were careless with yourself. You couldn’t cultivate your body, speech, and mind or mend your evil ways and follow good ones. Now, you’ll be made to recognize the pain of your carelessness!’
{:#p133}

134\. “The king also tells them, ‘Now, you’ll get your punishment. It wasn’t your parents’ mistake, not your brothers’ mistake, not the Lord of Gods or your previous ancestors’ mistake, not your associates’, employees’, or servants’ mistake, nor was it the mistake of ascetics or priests. It was your own evil, and now you’ll get what’s coming to you.’
{:#p134}

135\. “Having questioned the sinner about the second heavenly messenger, King Yama then asks them about the third heavenly messenger. ‘Didn’t you see the third heavenly messenger?’
{:#p135}

“They answer, ‘I didn’t.’

136\. “The king also asked, ‘While you were human before, didn’t you see someone who died? Whose body had broken up and their life ended? Whose faculties had forever ceased? Whose body is stiff like a withered tree, thrown onto a charnel ground? That’s eaten by birds and animals, dressed in a coffin, or cremated? Didn’t you see them?’
{:#p136}

“The sinner responds, ‘I actually did see them.’

137\. “The king replies, ‘Didn’t you think to yourself, “I’ll die, too. I’ll be no different than that!”?’
{:#p137}

“The sinner responds, ‘I was being careless at the time and didn’t realize that about myself.’

138\. “The king again says, ‘You were careless with yourself. You couldn’t cultivate your body, speech, and mind or mend your evil ways and follow good ones. Now, you’ll be made to recognize the pain of your carelessness!’
{:#p138}

139\. “The king also tells them, ‘Now, you’ll get your punishment. It wasn’t your parents’ mistake, not your brothers’ mistake, not the Lord of Gods or your previous ancestors’ mistake, not your associates’, employees’, or servants’ mistake, nor was it the mistake of ascetics or priests. It was your own evil, and now you’ll get what’s coming to you.’
{:#p139}

140\. “After questioning them about the three heavenly messengers, King Yama entrusts the sinner to the wardens of hell. The wardens lead the sinner to one of the great hells. The greats hells are a hundred yojanas across and a hundred yojanas deep.”
{:#p140}

141\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p141}

* {:.verse}“With four gates on four sides\\
And streets that connect them,\\
That hell’s walls are made of iron,\\
And iron nets cover it.

* {:.verse}The ground beneath it is iron\\
That spontaneously bursts in flames.\\
It’s a hundred yojanas across,\\
Standing firm and immovable.

* {:.verse}Black smoke rises from bright fires,\\
Burning red, they’re hard to look at.\\
With sixteen lesser hells,\\
Its fires blaze as a result of doing evil.”

##### King Yama Wishes for Liberation

142\. The Buddha told the monks, “King Yama then had this thought occur to him, ‘The world’s sentient beings are deluded and unaware. Their physical conduct is bad, and their verbal and mental conduct are bad. After their lives end, few of them won’t experience this suffering. If the world’s sentient beings could mend their evil ways and cultivate good physical, verbal, and mental conduct, they would experience happiness when their lives end as gods and spirits.
{:#p142}

143\. “‘If I’m born among humans after my life ends, perhaps I’ll encounter a Tathāgata. I’ll cut off my hair and beard and put on the three Dharma robes in the correct teaching. I’ll leave home and cultivate the path. I’ll cultivate the pure religious life with pure faith. Having accomplished the task, I’ll put an end to birth and death. I’ll realize for myself in the present life that I won’t be subject to another existence.’”
{:#p143}

144\. The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:
{:#p144}

* {:.verse}“Though they see heaven’s messengers,\\
Still, they are careless.\\
Such people always feel sorrow\\
And are born in despicable places.

* {:.verse}If they’re wise people\\
Who see the heavenly messengers,\\
They stay close to the noble teaching\\
And don’t act carelessly.

* {:.verse}Seeing and knowing it, they feel fearful\\
Of birth, old age, illness, and death.\\
Not experiencing those things is liberation,\\
The end of birth, old age, illness, and death.

* {:.verse}They find the place of safety\\
And attain the unconditioned in the present.\\
Having forded sorrows and fears,\\
They are certain to parinirvāṇa.”

### Notes

1. {:#n1}This is Chapter 4 of <em>sūtra</em> no. 30 of the <cite>Dīrgha Āgama</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0001_p0121b28" target="_blank">T1.1.121b28-7a26</a>).This chapter is one of the most brutally detailed descriptions of the Buddhist hells. Parallels are found in the <cite>Commentary to the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T25n1509_p0175c18" target="_blank">T1509.25.175c18ff</a>), Vasubandhu’s <cite>Abhidharma Kośa</cite>, and the <cite>The Correct Dharma Abode of Mindfulness Sūtra</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T17n0721_p0027a17" target="_blank">T721.27a17ff</a>). This version differs somewhat from the presentation of eight hot and eight cold hells found in the above Sarvāstivāda accounts, but the two versions appear to derive from a common source. They share many of the same names of their hells, but the descriptions are often quite different. They also both include the concept of sixteen lesser hells. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2}These names were translated to Chinese, and their meanings sometimes suggest different S. equivalents than we find in later sources. For example, the first great hell is called Saṃjīva (“survival”) in later sources, but here it clearly was Saṃjñā (“perception”) instead. I’ve indicated these reconstructions with \* when they don’t agree with later sources. Briefly, the meanings of these names are: Perception (Saṃjñā), Black Cord (Kālasūtra), Struck Together (\*Saṃhata), Wailing (\*Roravaṇa), Screaming (\*Mahāroravaṇa), Roasting Fire (Tapana), Great Roasting Fire (Mahātapana), and Uninterrupted (Avīci). [\[back\]](#ref2)
3. {:#n3}The names of the sixteen lesser hells were also translated to Chinese. It’s more difficult to reconstruct all of them to S. equivalents, so I’ve translated them to English. [\[back\]](#ref3)
4. {:#n4}<em>three [heavenly] messengers.</em> This section is parallel with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.36" target="_blank">AN 3.36</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn130" target="_blank">MN 130</a>. [\[back\]](#ref4)
