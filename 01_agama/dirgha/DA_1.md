    <td id='p2'>2. It was then that the monks gathered in the Flowering Grove Hall<sup id="ref4"><a href="#n4">4</a></sup> after soliciting alms.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>There are a number of ways to read the Chinese title <span class="ch">大本</span>. “Great Root,” “Great Beginning,” or “Great Origin” are possible meanings. One might wonder if it translates something different than S. <em>Mahāvadāna</em>, but we can find more support for the traditional title at the conclusion of the <em>sūtra</em>, where it was translated as <span class="ch">大因縁</span>. <span class="ch">因縁</span> is itself ambiguous, translating a number of Indic words, but S. <em>avadāna</em> is among them. In any case, I’ve translated the title as “Great Legend” on the assumption that the original title was in fact <em>Mahāvadāna</em>. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 1 of the <cite>Dīrgha Āgama</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0001_p0001b11" target="_blank">T1.1.1b12-10c29</a>). It’s a direct parallel to the Pali <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn14" target="_blank"> <em>Mahāpadāna Sutta</em></a> (DN 14) and the Chinese <span class="ch"><a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T0002_001" target="_blank">七佛經</a></span> (T2). There’s also a reconstructed Sanskrit <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sf36" target="_blank"><em>Mahāvadāna Sūtra</em></a> based on manuscripts found in Turkestan.</p>
<p>In addition to these full parallels, Chinese <span class="ch"><a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T0003_001" target="_blank">毘婆尸佛經</a></span> (T3) is a separate text titled <em>The Legend of Vipaśyin</em>, and Chinese <span class="ch"><a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T0004_001" target="_blank">七佛父母姓字經</a></span> (T4) and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T02n0125_p0790a07" target="_blank">EĀ 48.4</a> are independent <em>Seven Buddhas sūtras</em>. The existence of these two texts suggests that the <em>Mahāvadāna Sūtra</em> may be an expansion of an earlier <em>Seven Buddhas Sūtra</em>. In any case, they serve as additional parallels to the first half of DĀ 1.</p>
<p>T2 and T3 are a special case. Both were produced by the same Chinese translator working during the opening years of the Song era (late 10th c. CE). T2 ends abruptly without a proper conclusion, and T3 begins abruptly without a proper introduction. Taken together, they appear to belong to a complete edition of the <em>Mahāvadāna Sūtra</em>. If this is true, some material in the middle may have been lost, which caused it to be divided into two fragments. Āgamas typically fell into obscurity in China and weren’t well maintained, so this would be a plausible explanation.</p>
<p>There may also be a Mūlasarvāstivāda edition that has survived among the fragments of a Sanskrit DĀ that was discovered, but a reconstructed manuscript has not been published yet to my knowledge.</p>
<p>All told, then, I can compare versions of this <em>sūtra</em> from the Theravāda (DN 14), Dharmaguptaka (DĀ 1), and as many as four other undetermined early Buddhist canons (Turkestan S., T2/T3, T4, and EĀ 48.4). [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>Flowering Grove Hut</em>. The Chinese translation is in general agreement with P. <em>Karerikuṭikā</em>, which means “Musk Rose Tree Hut.” This place-name is missing from the S. and the other C. translations, which only mention Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park. The P. edition mentions both locations. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>Flowering Grove Hall</em>. C. <span class="ch">花林堂</span>. All editions except for EĀ 48.4 agree on the name of this place. In the present text, S. <em>maṇḍalavāṭa</em> has been translated simply as “hall,” which is likely a simplification by the Chinese translator given the existence of the placename in extant G. texts. Edgerton (<em>BHSD</em> p. 416) reports that a <em>maṇḍalavāṭa</em> (lit. “circular garland”) was not a building but a circular area fenced off like a courtyard to serve as a sacred space. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p><em>such principles</em>. C. <span class="ch">如是法</span>, S. <em>evaṃdharmāṇa</em>. In the S. edition, the parallel passage indicates that <em>dharma</em> is plural, so I have translated accordingly. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p><em>nature of things</em>. C. <span class="ch">法性</span>. Typically, this C. term translated something like S. <em>dharmatā</em>, but both the P. and S. editions have instead <em>dharmadhātu</em> (“realm of the Dharma”), and the C. verses that follow will agree with this. <em>Dharmadhātu</em> here seems to refer to a pre-existent source of the Dharma that’s accessed by <em>buddha</em>s when they awaken to it. [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p><em>correct faith</em>. C. <span class="ch">平等信</span> (= <span class="ch">正信</span>?). There was sometimes confusion between S. <em>samyag</em> (“correct”), S. <em>sama</em> (“equal”), and the prefix S. <em>sam-</em> (“complete, thorough”) in early Chinese translations, perhaps because they were nearly the same in G. (<em>saṃma</em>, <em>sama</em>, and <em>sam-</em>, respectively). I’ve translated 平等信 assuming the original was the equivalent to S. <em>samyag śraddha</em>. The expression occurs often in the S. edition, but there are no parallels to this particular passage. Uncorrected, the passage reads “… with the same faith.”[<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n8"><p>The text of DĀ has random omissions throughout that appear to be the result of inattentive copying. Perhaps the person writing down the translation as it was given orally couldn’t keep up with the pace, or a later copyist may have been impatient with formulaic repetitions. Whatever the case may be, I have added back obvious omissions, placing the lost text in [] to indicate when I do so. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n9"><p><em>kalaviṅka</em>. C. <span class="ch">哀鸞</span>. This is a C. translation of S. <em>kalaviṅka</em>, which literally means something like “mourning phoenix.” The <em>kalaviṅka</em> was a semi-mythical bird depicted as living in mountains and singing gentle songs, even before it has hatched. Prosaically, it also referred to songbirds like the Indian cuckoo. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n10"><p>These life spans during each Buddha’s time agree with all extant parallels except for EĀ 48.4. There, Vipaśyin lived for 84,000 years (which agrees with DĀ 1’s verse below), and Krakucchanda and Kanakamuni lived for 50,000 and 40,000 years, respectively. [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n11"><p>Here, again, all extant parallels agree on these details except for EĀ 48.4. However, only the present text combines the tribe types and clans of the <em>buddha</em>s into a single section. The other versions divide these details between two sections. [<a href="#ref11">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n12"><p><em>patala tree … mango tree … sal tree … sirisa tree … cluster fig tree … banyan tree … sacred fig tree</em>. C. <span class="ch">波波羅</span> … <span class="ch">分陀利</span> … <span class="ch">娑羅</span> … <span class="ch">尸利沙</span> … <span class="ch">烏暫婆羅</span> … <span class="ch">尼拘律</span> … <span class="ch">鉢多</span>, S. <em>pāṭali</em> … <em>puṇḍarīka</em> … <em>sāla</em> … <em>śirīṣa</em> … <em>udumbara</em> … <em>nyagrodha</em> … <em>aśvattha</em>. These names agree with those found in the other parallels, but the transliterations of <em>pāṭali</em> and <em>aśvattha</em> are unclear.</p>
<p>C. <span class="ch">波波羅</span> suggests G. <em>*papala</em>, which may have been a variant pronunciation, or the C. may be corrupt. The <a href="https://gandhari.org/dictionary/pala%E1%B8%8Diputra" target="_blank">G. attestation of S. Pāṭaliputra</a> is G. Palaḍiputra. This would be a case of G. transposing consonants (swapping the <em>ṭ</em> and <em>l</em> and converting <em>ṭ</em> to <em>ḍ</em>). It’s notable, too, that the verse that follows translit. the name as <span class="ch">婆羅</span> (“pala”), which could correspond to <em>palaḍi</em> (dropping the final syllable to fit the meter of the verse). The translit. in EĀ 48.4 is similar (<span class="ch">波羅利</span> = “palali”), but in that case the <em>-ḍ-</em> has likely become <em>-ḷ-</em>. I have assumed the original was likely equivalent to S. <em>pāṭali</em> and moved on with my life.</p>
<p>C. <span class="ch">鉢多</span> is a well-known translit. for G. <em>patra</em> (“bowl”) but that would make little sense here. Observing that S. <em>aśva</em> = G. <em>aśpa</em>, I can only speculate that the initial syllable <em>aś-</em> has been contracted, leaving us with a translit. of G. <em>’pattha</em>. I’ve adopted the S. equivalent. [<a href="#ref12">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n13"><p>While there was substantial agreement among the parallels on these numbers, there was some confusion that took place, especially regarding Vipaśyin’s first assembly. Only the present text and EĀ 48.4 agree that it was 168,000. This figure is supported by the story that will be later told about his teaching career, where his first congregation is converted in two waves of 84,000 people.</p>
<p>This story about Vipaśyin converting his first congregation was apparently not shared by all traditions, for the other parallels have varying figures for this first congregation: 6.8 million (DN 14), 6.2 million (Turkestan S.), 62,000 (T2), and 100,000 (T4). It should be noted that these changes between tens of thousands and millions can occur by the addition of a word or two to the Indic way of spelling out numbers. Another oddity is found in T2, which gives 80 million for Śikhin’s second congregation.</p>
<p>All told, it’s a fascinating example of how random corruptions crept into these ancient texts in passages where arbitrary changes could appear legitimate. [<a href="#ref13">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n14"><p>This section is not found in EĀ 48.4, but the names of these disciples are remarkably consistent across this and the other four parallels that included it.</p>
<p>DĀ 1 has a number of variations peculiar to it: S. Bhujiṣya (G. *Bhuyo) and S. Śroṇa are transposed in comparison to the P. and S. versions of the list. It has G. Utama for the first S. Uttara, and S. Śrāvaṇa (G. *Ṣavana) instead of S. Śroṇa.</p>
<p>S. Saṃjīva appears to become S. Saṃjñin (G. *Saṃñi), which happens again when it serves as a name of a hell in <a href="DA_30-4.html" target="_blank">DĀ 30, Chapter 4</a>. There, it was translated as <span class="ch">想</span> (S. Saṃjña). In both cases, this would be the result of dropping the <em>-va</em> in G.</p>
<p>Finally, S. Vidhura is translit. as G. *Viru, which may have been G. *Virudha if the last syllable was dropped and the consonants were transposed.</p>
<p>These differences are likely the result of translations between Prakrits and some slight textual disorder. I’ve adopted the S. equivalents of these names. [<a href="#ref14">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n15"><p>All the parallels include this section, but EĀ 48.4 has an entirely different list other than concluding with Ānanda. Otherwise, there are only minor variations between the parallels (e.g., the S. parallel has Bhadrika instead of Buddhija).</p>
<p>Except for Ānanda, DĀ 1 translates this list of names, making precise readings difficult, but the meanings generally agree with the other parallels. For example, P. Sabbamitta appears to be translated as “good friend” (<span class="ch">善友</span>), which is usu. S. <em>kalyāṇamitra</em> or perhaps <em>sumitra</em>. I’ve converted these translations to S. literally, but they could be freer interpretations of the names found in P. and S. The most divergent reading is “Peace” (<span class="ch">安和</span>) where the parallels have S. Svastika (P. Sotthija). This Chinese word is used parallel to S. Kṣema later on. [<a href="#ref15">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n16"><p>Only two other parallels include this section: the S. version and Taisho 4. DĀ 1 translates these names, and they match those found in Taisho 4 slightly better than the S. edition. I.e., Taisho 4 agrees with DĀ 1’s translation of S. Uttara (<span class="ch">上勝</span>) where the S. edition has S. Pratāpana. [<a href="#ref16">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n17"><p>This section detailing the names of each Buddha’s parents, capital city, and reigning kings is found in all parallels except EĀ 48.4. While there are quite a few disagreements in the names we find in the other four parallels, the confusion most often involves the names of mothers, with those of fathers being a lesser issue. Given the degree of agreement on the names of fathers and cities, it seems that the mothers may have been an addition made independently by different traditions. [<a href="#ref17">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n18"><p><em>Universal Vision</em>. C. <span class="ch">遍眼</span>. This was a translation of S. Vipaśyin. [<a href="#ref18">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n19"><p><em>Prabhāvatī</em>. C. <span class="ch">光曜</span>. Strictly speaking, the C. translates only S. <em>prabhā</em>, but the other parallels that agree have S. <em>prabhāvatī</em>. The situation is similar with the capital’s name. The C. translates only S. <em>aruṇa</em>, but all the parallels list S. <em>aruṇavatī</em>. T2 disagrees with the others in naming the mother S. <em>aruṇī</em>, which mirrors the naming of Vipaśyin’s parents as the male and female of the same name. [<a href="#ref19">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n20"><p><em>Yaśovatī</em>. C. <span class="ch">稱戒</span>. This translation lit. means “famous precept” or “famous morality.” <span class="ch">稱</span> is straightforward as a translation of S. <em>yaśa</em>. T4 transliterates the mother’s name as S. <em>yaśovatī</em> (<span class="ch">耶舍越提</span>), and the S. edition here transposes the names S. <em>uttarā</em> and <em>yaśovatī</em>. DN 14 has P. <em>vassavatī,</em> which could be a variation of the same. Given this, my suspicion is that <span class="ch">戒</span> here translated G. <em>vati</em> read as equiv. to P. <em>vatti</em> > S. <em>vṛtti</em> (c.f., G. <em>vaji</em> = P. <em>vajji</em> = S. <em>vṛji</em>), which can mean “moral conduct.” I’ve found no attestation of this in G. sources, but it would explain the C. translation. Finally, T2 disagrees with the rest, giving S. <em>prabhāvatī</em> (<span class="ch">鉢囉婆嚩底</span>) as her name. [<a href="#ref20">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n21"><p><em>Yajñadatta</em>. C. <span class="ch">祀得</span>. This translation lit. means “sacrifice obtained,” which would match S. <em>yajñadatta</em> well enough. This name occurs in the next section in the other parallels.</p>
<p><em>Suśākhā</em>. C. <span class="ch">善枝</span>. This translates lit. to “Good Branch,” which translates S. <em>su-</em> and <em>-śākhā</em> separately. Supporting this reading is T4, which translit. the mother’s name as S. <em>suśākhā</em> (<span class="ch">隨舍迦</span>). DN 14 and T2 agree on S. <em>viśākhā</em>, and the S. edition again transposes names, this time swapping S. <em>viśākhā</em> and <em>dhanavatī</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, the C. translates the capital’s name as simply <span class="ch">安和</span> (S. <em>kṣema</em>), but the other parallels have S. <em>kṣemāvatī</em>. The exception is T2, which appears to translit. S. <em>kṣemokṣemā</em> (<span class="ch">剎謨剎摩</span>). [<a href="#ref21">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n22"><p><em>Mahādatta</em>. C. <span class="ch">大徳</span>. This translation lit. means “great virtue.” The straightforward conversion to S. would be <em>mahādatta</em>, which is a name attested in Pali sources. DĀ 1 is alone in this reading, however: The other parallels have S. <em>yajñadatta</em> or variations thereof.</p>
<p><em>Sūttara</em>. C. <span class="ch">善勝</span>. This translates lit. to “good superiority,” which would translate S. <em>su-</em> and <em>-uttara</em> separately. The S. name means “very superior.” The other parallels all have S. <em>uttarā</em>, except for the S. edition, which has transposed S. <em>uttarā</em> with S. <em>yaśovatī</em>.</p>
<p><em>Śubha</em>. C. <span class="ch">清淨</span>. This translates to “pure,” which seems likely to be G. <em>śuha</em> (S. <em>śubha</em>). DN 14 and the S. edition have S. <em>śobha</em> (P. <em>sobha</em>). [<a href="#ref22">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n23"><p><em>Kṛpī</em>. C. <span class="ch">汲毗</span> (EMC. kɪəp-bii = G. *<em>kivi</em>). This would seem to be equiv. to S. <em>kṛpī</em>, which disagrees with P. <em>kikī</em> and S. edition’s <em>kṛkī</em>. T2 agrees with DN 14 and S. edition, but T4 appears to transliterate G. <em>kiṣida</em> (= S. <em>kr̥ṣṭa</em>). [<a href="#ref23">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n24"><p><em>Mahāmāyā</em>. C. <span class="ch">大清淨妙</span>. This translation lit. means “great pure wonder.” The other parallels agree that her name was S. <em>māyā</em> (DN 14) or S. <em>mahāmāyā</em> (the others). It’s curious that DĀ 1 has “pure wonder,” but perhaps this was a translation of S. <em>māyā</em>. [<a href="#ref24">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n25"><p>This re-introduction signals that a second discourse is beginning. In DN 14, the second introduction is quite verbose. Not only does it replicate the introduction to the Seven Buddhas discourse, but the Buddha summarizes all of the biographical details for Vipaśyin before moving on to telling the audience any new information. 
</p>
<p>The second introduction in Taisho 2 also depicts the monks holding another discussion that’s again overheard by the Buddha. The Turkestan Sanskrit edition lacks a segue between the two halves of the <em>sūtra</em>.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that Taisho 3 begins the story of Bodhisattva Vipaśyin without an introduction and picks up at the point of his encounter with the four signs and decision to leave home.</p>
<p>Here in DĀ 1, the second introduction has been minimized, but it still remains. [<a href="#ref25">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n26"><p>From this section down to the beginning of the story of the Bodhisattva’s thirty-two signs, DĀ 1 has ten brief sections on his mother’s pregnancy and his birth. There is a strong agreement between this version and what we find in Taisho 2. They share the same order and differ only in each adding a different section. I.e., Taisho 2 has a section depicting the gods announcing to each other that the Bodhisattva has descended into a mother’s womb, and it lacks the section depicting the Bodhisattva walking seven paces at birth. Otherwise, DĀ 1 and Taisho 2 share exactly the same outline of this section of the story. In fact, DĀ 1 mentions the Bodhisattva’s name being announced in its verse, which may be an oblique reference to the section included only in Taisho 2.</p>
<p>This close correspondence between DĀ 1 and Taisho 2 stops after this part of the story. This is because Taisho 2 lacks the elaborate storytelling about the Buddha’s thirty-two signs, his leaving home, his awakening, and his teaching career afterward. DĀ 1, like DN 14 and the other parallels, has added all of this material. Taisho 2, which looks like an older and simpler version, covers all of this (except for the Buddha’s teaching career) with six brief sections of the same size and format as the ones covering the Bodhisattva’s birth.</p>
<p>In contrast to Taisho 2’s simplicity, Taisho 3 tells an elaborate story that begins with the Bodhisattva encountering the four signs. It therefore contains no parallel with this section of the story about his mother and birth.</p>
<p>DN 14 and the Sanskrit edition have both added a few sections to the older core of this part of the story. DN 14 adds five sections: on his mother enjoying the five sense desires, on his mother dying and being reborn in Tuṣita, on the length of her pregnancy, on the gods delivering him, and on the gods catching him before he hit the ground. On the first addition, only DĀ 1 and DN 14 mention that his mother had no lust; the other two parallels only say she was unattached to sense desires. DN 14 created a separate section for her lack of lust, and DĀ 1 added it to the section on her detachment from desires in general. There is some disorder in DN 14 compared to the other parallels, too. For instance, the omens of light and earthquakes when he is born is placed at the end of the section rather than at the middle when the description of his birth begins.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit edition also adds more sections to the core story, but differently than DN 14. It adds a section on a stream flowing from a well and the gods making offerings of flowers and music to the Bodhisattva. It also divides a section into two that in the other versions mentions both his mother being in comfort and seeing the Bodhisattva in her womb. [<a href="#ref26">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n27"><p><em>elephant</em>. C. <span class="ch">大龍</span>, S. <em>mahānāga</em>. S. <em>nāga</em> typically refers to serpents, either mythological or ordinary, but it did sometimes refer to elephants. Given that this <em>nāga</em> walks, <em>mahānāga</em> here must mean a bull elephant. [<a href="#ref27">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n28"><p>At this point, the story of the Bodhisattva begins to replicate the events we find in the epics of the Buddha’s life like the <em>Buddhacarita</em> and <em>Lalitavistara</em>. DĀ 1, DN 14, and the S. edition all agree in the main in this section, differing only in the degree of verbosity and giving lists of the signs that differ in their order and level of detail. T2 differs from the other versions in that it has one section stating that the Bodhisattva was born with the thirty-two signs, and then another section about his father summoning the fortune tellers. Neither section included a list of signs.</p>
<p><em>fortune tellers and seers</em>. C. <span class="ch">相師及諸道術</span>, P. <em>nemitta brāhmaṇa</em>, S. <em>brāhmaṇa naimitta</em>. The parallel expression in DN 14 reads “fortune tellers and priests.” A couple passages later in DĀ indicate that 道術 (lit. “techniques of the Way”) refers to methods of meditation (cf. T1.7a15-16 and T1.23c13-17). If the people summoned were simply priests, I would expect one of the usual translations of S. <em>brāhmaṇa</em> found in DĀ, but <span class="ch">道術</span> only occurs here as a profession and as techniques of meditation in the above two passages. As a result, it would seem the C. translator understood the term to mean someone who had attained spiritual knowledge through meditation. I’ve translated <span class="ch">道術</span> here as “seer” to approximate this. [<a href="#ref28">back</a>]</p></li>
