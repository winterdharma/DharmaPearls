34\. “Lord Śakra then turns his attention to the two stone seats called Bhadra and Subhadra. When he sits, each of the Trāyastriṃśa god kings take turns sitting with him in their order.
{:#p34}

35\. “Again, there are gods who aren’t able to follow them and see that scenic park, aren’t able to enter the park, nor are they entertained by the five desires there. Why is that? As a result of their past conduct, their virtue isn’t equal to that of the others.
{:#p35}

{:#p39}

40\. “Why is that park called ‘Pāruṣaka Park’? When they enter this park, their bodies become rough. Why is that other park named ‘Citraratha Park’? When they enter this park, their bodies are spontaneously painted with a variety of colors, which delights them. Why is that other park named ‘Miśrakā Park’? On the eighth, tenth, and fifteenth day of every month, attractive females other than female asuras are sent to accompany the gods there. They roam that park and mingle, so it’s called Miśrakā Park. Why is that other park named ‘Nandana Park’? When the gods go to this park, they entertain themselves and rejoice. So, it’s called Nandana.
{:#p40}

41\. “Why is that hall named ‘Sudharma Hall’? Up in this hall, they ponder the wonderful Dharma and experience pure happiness, so it’s called Sudharma Hall. Why is that tree named the ‘Pārijāta Tree’? This tree has a spirit named Manda that’s always playing music to entertain itself. Therefore, it’s called Pārijāta.

Their final consciousness ceases here, and an initial consciousness arises in a human. Because of that consciousness, they have name and form. Because of that name and form, they have the six senses.

##### Birth among the Four God Kings

71\. “Sometimes, a sentient being commits good physical deeds, speaks good words, and thinks good thoughts. When their body breaks up and their life ends, they are born among the four god kings. Their final consciousness ceases here, and an initial consciousness arises among the four god kings. Because of that consciousness, they have name and form. Because of that name and form, they have the six senses.
{:#p71}

72\. “When those gods are first born, they’re like one- or two-year-old human children. They spontaneously appear sitting on a god’s knee. That god then says, ‘This is my child!’
{:#p72}

73\. “As a reward for their conduct, knowledge spontaneously arises in them. They think to themselves, ‘What was the conduct that caused me to be born here now?’ Then they also think, ‘I was once among humans and did good physical deeds, spoke good words, and had good thoughts. It was because of this conduct that I’ve been born as a god now. If my life were to end and I were born again among humans, I would be physically, verbally, and mentally pure. I’d redouble my efforts and cultivate these good conducts.’
{:#p73}

74\. “Not long after the child’s birth, they realize that they’re hungry. A treasure bowl then spontaneously appears in front of the child, which is full of spontaneously pure food with a hundred heavenly flavors. If the child has much merit, the food’s color is white. If the child’s merit is average, then the food’s color is blue. If the child’s merit is inferior, then the food’s color is red. The child then takes the food and puts it in their mouth, and it’s spontaneously digested like butter thrown into a fire.
{:#p74}

75\. “When the child is finished eating, they realize that they’re thirsty. A treasure bowl spontaneously appears that’s filled with ambrosia. If the child has much merit, the ambrosia’s color is white. If the child’s merit is average, then the ambrosia’s color is blue. If the child’s merit is inferior, then the ambrosia’s color is red. The child picks up the ambrosia and drinks it, and it’s spontaneously digested like butter thrown into a fire.
{:#p75}

76\. “After the child finishes eating and drinking, their body grows larger until it’s equal to that of other gods. That god then goes into a pool to bathe, washing and enjoying themselves. After enjoying themselves there, the god emerges from the pool and stands under a perfume tree. The perfume tree bends down, and they take many fragrances to rub on their body.
{:#p76}

77\. “Again, the god goes to a clothing tree. The tree bends down, and they take various clothes to wear.
{:#p77}

78\. “Again, the god goes to an ornament tree. The tree bends down, and they take various ornaments to decorate their body.
{:#p78}

79\. “Again, the god goes to a garland tree. The tree bends down, and they take garlands to put over their head.
{:#p79}

80\. “Again, the god goes to a vessel tree. The tree bends down, and they take a treasure vessel.
{:#p80}

81\. “Again, the god goes to a fruit tree. The tree bends down, and they take its spontaneous fruit. They might eat it, put in their mouth, or drink its juice.
{:#p81}

82\. “Again, the god goes to a musical instrument tree. The tree bends down, and they take heavenly instruments. With wondrous voices in harmony with the music, they go to forest parks. Seeing countless goddesses singing and playing drums, they smile and chat with them.
{:#p82}

83\. “When those gods go sightseeing, they become defiled and attached. They look east and forget what’s west, or they look west and forget what’s east. When they’re first born, they thought to themselves, ‘What was the conduct that caused me to be born here now?’ But when they go sightseeing, they forget all about that, and the attractive goddesses attend to them.
{:#p83}

##### Birth among the Trāyastriṃśa Gods

84\. “When a sentient being does good physical deeds, speaks good words, and thinks good thoughts, they are born in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven when their body breaks up and their life ends. Their final consciousness ceases here, and an initial consciousness arises [in one of those gods]. Because of that consciousness, they have name and form. Because of that name and form, they have the six senses.
{:#p84}

85\. “When that god is first born, they’re like a two- or three-year-old child in Jambudvīpa. They spontaneously appear on a god’s knee, and that god says, ‘This is my son!’ or ‘This is my daughter!’ in the same way.
{:#p85}

##### The Three Fasting Days

94\. The Buddha told the monks, “There are three fasts during a half month. What are the three? The eighth day is a fasting day, the fourteenth day is a fasting day, and the fifteenth day is a fasting day. These are the three fasts.
{:#p94}

95\. “Why is there a fast on the eighth day of the month? Every eighth day of the month, the four god kings tell their servants, ‘Go check on the conduct of the world. Examine the multitude of people. Are they dutiful to their parents? Do they respect the ascetics and priests? Do they honor and serve their elders? Do they observe the fasting rules, give offerings, and aid the poor?’
{:#p95}

96\. “After hearing the kings’ instruction, their servants go check on the conduct of the world to know if they are dutiful to their parents, respect the ascetics and priests, honor and serve their elders, and observe the fasting rules, give offerings, and aid the poor. After they’ve examined them, they see that the world’s people aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t respect the ascetics and priests, don’t honor or serve their elders, and don’t observe the fasting rules, give offerings, or aid the poor. They return to the kings and say, ‘Heavenly Kings, those in the world who are dutiful to their parents, honor their elders, cultivate the fasting rules purely, give offerings, and aid the poor are very few. Very few, indeed!’
{:#p96}

97\. “When the four god kings hear this, they’re distraught and unhappy. They reply, ‘What!? How did this happen? Most of the world’s people are bad. They aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t serve their elders, don’t cultivate the fasting rules, nor aid the poor. The host of gods will dwindle, and the host of asuras will grow!’
{:#p97}

98\. “Suppose their servants see that the world’s people are dutiful to their parents, respect their elders, diligently cultivate the fasting rules, and aid the poor. They return and tell the god kings, ‘The world’s people are dutiful to their parents, respect their elders, diligently cultivate the fasting rules, and aid the poor.’
{:#p98}

99\. “When the four god kings hear this, they rejoice. They exclaim, ‘Excellent! We’ve heard good news! The world’s people are capable of being dutiful to their parents, respecting their elders, diligently cultivating the fasting rules, and aiding the poor. The host of gods will grow, and the host of asuras will dwindle!’ [This is why there’s a fast on the eighth day.]
{:#p99}

100\. “Why is there a fast on the fourteenth day of the month? On the fourteenth day fast, the four god kings tell their princes, ‘Go check on the conduct of the world. Examine the multitudes of people. Are they dutiful to their parents? Do they honor and serve their elders? Do they observe the fasting rules and aid the poor?’
{:#p100}

101\. “After receiving the kings’ instruction, the princes check on the conduct of the world. They examine the multitudes of people to know if they are dutiful to their parents, honor and serve their elders, diligently cultivate the fasting rules, and aid the poor. After they’ve examined them, they see that the world’s people aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t respect their elders, don’t cultivate the fasting rules, nor aid the poor. They return and tell the kings, ‘Heavenly Kings, those in the world who are dutiful to their parents, respect their elders, cultivate the fasting rules purely, give offerings, and aid the poor are very few. Very few, indeed!’
{:#p101}

102\. “When the four god kings hear this, they’re distraught and unhappy. They reply, ‘What!? How did this happen? Most of the world’s people are bad. They aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t serve their elders, don’t cultivate the fasting rules, nor aid the poor. The host of gods will dwindle, and the host of asuras will grow!’
{:#p102}

103\. “Suppose the princes see that the world’s people are dutiful to their parents, respect their elders, diligently cultivate the fasting rules, and aid the poor. They return and tell the god kings, ‘The world’s people are dutiful to their parents, respect their elders, diligently cultivate the fasting rules, and aid the poor.’
{:#p103}

104\. “When the four god kings hear this, they rejoice. They exclaim, ‘Excellent! We’ve heard good news! The world’s people are capable of being dutiful to their parents, respecting their elders, diligently cultivating the fasting rules, and aiding the poor. The host of gods will grow, and the host of asuras will dwindle!’ This is why there’s a fast on the fourteenth day.
{:#p104}

105\. “Why is there a fast on the fifteenth day? On the fifteenth day fast, the four god kings personally go down to check on the conduct of the world. They examine the multitude of people. ‘Do the world’s people prefer to be dutiful to their parents, respectful to their elders, diligently cultivate the fasting rules, and aid the poor?’ They see that many of the world’s people aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t serve their elders, don’t diligently cultivate the fasting rules, nor aid the poor.
{:#p105}

106\. “The four god king then go to the Sudharma Hall and tell Lord Śakra, ‘Great King, you should know that many sentient beings in the world aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t respect their elders, don’t cultivate the fasting rules, nor aid the poor.’
{:#p106}

107\. “When they hear this, Lord Śakra and the Trāyastriṃśa gods are distraught and unhappy. They say, ‘What!? How did this happen? Most of the world’s people are bad. They aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t respect their elders, don’t cultivate the fasting rules, nor aid the poor. The host of gods will dwindle, and the host of asuras will grow!’
{:#p107}

108\. “Suppose the four god kings see that the world’s people are dutiful to their parents, honor and serve their elders, diligently cultivate the fasting rules, and aid the poor. They return to the Sudharma Hall and tell Lord Śakra, ‘The world’s people are dutiful to their parents, honor and serve their elders, diligently cultivate the fasting rules, and aid the poor.’
{:#p108}

109\. “When they hear this, Lord Śakra and the Trāyastriṃśa gods rejoice. They exclaim, ‘Excellent! The world’s people are dutiful to their parents, honor and serve their elders, diligently cultivate the fasting rules, and aid the poor. The host of gods will grow, and the host of asuras will dwindle!’ This is why there’s a fast on the fifteenth day.
{:#p109}

110\. “These are the reasons for these three fasts.
{:#p110}

##### Śakra’s Verse Praising the Fasts

111\. “Lord Śakra then wants the gods rejoice twice as much, so he speaks this verse:
{:#p111}

* {:.verse} “‘Every month on the eighth day\\
And the fourteenth and fifteenth days,\\
Those who accept and cultivate the fasting rules\\
Will become my equals!’”

112\. The Buddha told the monks, “Lord Śakra speaks this verse, but it’s neither well put nor well spoken. I wouldn’t agree with it. Why is that? That Lord of Gods Śakra hasn’t ended lust, anger, and delusion, and he isn’t free from birth, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble. I say such a person isn’t yet free of the basis for suffering.
{:#p112}

113\. “Suppose a monk of mine is an arhat who’s ended the contaminants, who’s accomplished the task, put done the heavy burden, won their own reward, ended the bonds of existence, and become fully liberated. Such a monk should speak this verse:
{:#p113}

* {:.verse} “‘Every month on the eighth day\\
And the fourteenth and fifteenth days,\\
Those who accept and cultivate the fasting rules\\
Will become my equals!’”

114\. The Buddha told the monks, “When that monk speaks this verse, I call it well put and well spoken. I would agree with it. Why is that? That monk has ended lust, anger, and delusion, and he’s freed from birth, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble. I say that person is free of the basis for suffering.”
{:#p114}

##### Yakṣa Spirits that Inhabit the Earth

115\. The Buddha told the monks, “The homes, dwellings, and buildings of all people have yakṣa spirits. None are empty of them. Yakṣa spirits are in all avenues, streets, intersections, butcher shops, markets, and graveyards. None are empty of them. All those yakṣa spirits are named for their places of refuge. They’re named for the people, towns, cities, countries, lands, mountains, and rivers in which they take refuge.”
{:#p115}

116\. The Buddha told the monks, “All trees, even the smallest of them that are the size of wheel hubs, have yakṣa spirits who take refuge in them. None of them are empty. All men and women when they are first born have yakṣa spirits who protect them. At the time of their death, those guardian yakṣa spirits take their spirits, and then they die.”
{:#p116}

117\. The Buddha told the monks, “Suppose there are practitioners from other religions who ask, ‘Gentlemen, suppose that all men and women have yakṣa spirits who follow them as protectors from when they are first born. When they’re about to die, those guardian yakṣa spirits take their spirits, and then they die. Why are there yakṣa spirits who harass people, or are there no yakṣa spirits who harass people?’
{:#p117}

118\. “Supposing someone asks this question, you should answer in this way, ‘Worldly people do things contrary to the Dharma, become deluded by wrong views, and commit the ten bad deeds. There may be only one <em>yakṣa</em> spirit for every hundred or thousand of these people, just as a herd of a hundred or a thousand cattle or sheep has only one a person tending it. Those <em>yakṣa</em> spirits are likewise for people who act contrary to the Dharma, become deluded by wrong views, and commit the ten bad deeds. There’s only one spirit guarding a hundred or a thousand of those people.
{:#p118}

119\. “‘Suppose there are people who practice the good Dharma, who’s views are correct and act according to their belief, and who perfect the ten good deeds. One such person has a hundred or a thousand spirits protecting them, just as the king or a king’s minister has a hundred or a thousand people guarding them. They are likewise. A single person who practices the good Dharma and perfects the ten good deeds has a hundred or a thousand spirits protecting them. As a result of this, some worldly people are harassed by yakṣa spirits, and some are not harassed by them.’”
{:#p119}

##### Comparing Various Places to Jambudvīpa

120\. The Buddha told the monks, “People in Jambudvīpa have three ways they are better than people in Godānīya. What are the three? First, they are courageous, have good memories, and can perform their work. Second, they are courageous, have good memories, and diligently cultivate the religious life. Third, they are courageous, have good memories, and buddhas appear in their land. These are three ways they are better than people in Godānīya.

{:#p125}

126\. “People in Jambudvīpa are also better than hungry ghosts in the above three ways.

{:#p138}

##### The Spirits of the Four Gross Elements

139\. The Buddha told the monks, “There are spirits of the four gross elements. What are the four? First is the earth spirit, second is the water spirit, third is the wind spirit, and fourth is the fire spirit.
{:#p139}

140\. “Once, the earth spirit had a bad view. She said, ‘There’s no water, fire, or wind in earth.’
{:#p140}

141\. “Knowing that the earth spirit had this thought, I went to her and said, ‘Did you have this thought, “There’s no water, fire, or wind in earth”?’
{:#p141}

“The earth spirit replied, ‘There really is no water, fire, or wind in earth.’

142\. “I then said, ‘Don’t have this thought that there’s no water, fire, or wind in earth. Why is that? There’s water, fire, and wind in earth. It’s only because there’s much more earth present that it’s called the earth element.’”
{:#p142}

143\. The Buddha told the monks, “That time I spoke with the earth spirit, I successively taught her the Dharma, removed her bad view by teaching, instructing, profiting, and delighting her. I discussed generosity, precepts, how to be born in heaven, that desire is impure, and the trouble of the higher contaminants. [I praised] escaping [desire] as the [most subtle, pure, and] supreme thing. I broadly explained and revealed the pure religious life to her. I then knew that her mind was pure, gentle, gladdened, devoid of the hindrances, and easy to teach. According to the eternal way of buddhas, I taught the noble truth of suffering and the truths of suffering’s formation, suffering’s cessation, and suffering’s escape. I explained them broadly for her.
{:#p143}

144\. “The earth spirit became removed from dust and free of defilement right there on her seat, and her vision of the Dharma was purified. The earth spirit was like white cloth that readily accepts a dye. Her faith was purified, and she attained the Dharma eye without any doubts. Seeing the Dharma with certainty, she didn’t fall to the unpleasant destinies, nor did she set out on some other path. Achieving fearlessness, she said to me, ‘I now take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge in the Dharma, and take refuge in the Saṅgha. I won’t kill, steal, engage in sex, lie, or drink alcohol for the rest of my life. Permit me to become a laywoman in the correct Dharma.’”
{:#p144}

145\. The Buddha told the monks, “Once, the water spirit had a bad view. She said, ‘There’s no earth, fire, or wind in water.’
{:#p145}

146\. “Knowing that the water spirit had this view, the earth spirit went to her and said, ‘Did this view really occur to you, “There’s no earth, fire, or wind in water”?’
{:#p146}

“She replied, ‘It really did.’

147\. “The earth spirit then said, ‘Don’t have this view that there’s no earth, fire, or wind in water. Why is that? There’s earth, fire, and wind in water. It’s only because there’s much more water present that it’s called the water element.’”
{:#p147}

148\. The Buddha told the monks, “The earth spirit taught the Dharma for the water spirit, removing her bad view by teaching, instructing, profiting, and delighting her. She discussed generosity, precepts, how to be born in heaven, that desire is impure, and the trouble of the higher contaminants. [She praised] escaping [desire] as the [most subtle, pure, and] supreme thing. She broadly explained and revealed the pure religious life to her. The earth spirit then knew that the water spirit’s mind was gentle, gladdened, confident, purified, devoid of the hindrances, and easy to teach. According to the eternal way of buddhas, she taught the noble truth of suffering and the truths of suffering’s formation, suffering’s cessation, and suffering’s escape. She explained them broadly for her.
{:#p148}

149\. “The water spirit became removed from dust and free of defilement right there on her seat, and her vision of the Dharma was purified. The water spirit was like white cloth that readily accepts a dye. Her faith was purified, and she attained purity of the Dharma eye without any doubts. Attaining the reward of certainty, she didn’t fall to the unpleasant destinies, nor did she set out on some other path. Achieving fearlessness, she told the earth spirit, ‘I now take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge in the Dharma, and take refuge in the Saṅgha. I won’t kill, steal, engage in sex, lie, or drink alcohol for the rest of my life. Permit me to become a laywoman in the correct Dharma.’”
{:#p149}

150\. The Buddha told the monks, “Once, the fire spirit had a bad view. She said, ‘There’s no earth, water, or wind in fire.’
{:#p150}

151\. “Knowing that the fire spirit had this view, the earth and water spirits both went to her and said, ‘Has this view really occurred to you[, “There’s no earth, water, or wind in fire”]?’
{:#p151}

“The fire spirit replied, ‘It really did.’

152\. “Both spirits said, ‘Don’t have this view [that there’s no earth, water, or wind in fire.] Why is that? There’s earth, water, and wind in fire. It’s only because there’s much more fire present that it’s called the fire element.’
{:#p152}

153\. “Those two spirits [successively] taught the fire spirit the Dharma, removing her bad view by teaching, instructing, profiting, and delighting her. They discussed generosity, precepts, how to be born in heaven, that desire is impure, and the trouble of the higher contaminants. [They praised] escaping desire as the [most subtle, pure, and] supreme thing. They broadly explained and revealed the pure religious life to her. Those two spirits then knew that the fire spirit’s mind was gentle, gladdened, confident, pure, devoid of the hindrances, and easy to teach.

Attaining the reward of certainty, she didn’t fall to the unpleasant destinies, nor did she set out on some other path.

155\. The Buddha told the monks, “Once, the wind spirit had a bad view. She said, ‘There’s no earth, water, or fire in wind.’
{:#p155}

156\. “The earth, water, and fire spirits knew this thought that the wind spirit had, so they went to her and said, ‘Has this view really occurred to you, “There’s no earth, water, or fire in wind”?’
{:#p156}

“The wind spirit replied, ‘It really did.’

157\. “Those three spirits then said, ‘Don’t have this view [that there’s no earth, water, or fire in wind]. Why is that? There’s earth, water, and fire in wind. It’s only because there’s much more wind present that it’s called the wind element.’”
{:#p157}

158\. The Buddha told the monks, “Those three spirits [successively] taught the wind spirit the Dharma, removed her bad view by teaching, instructing, profiting, and delighting her. They discussed generosity, precepts, how to be born in heaven, that desire is impure, and the trouble of the higher contaminants. [They praised] escaping desire as the [most subtle, pure, and] supreme thing. They broadly explained and revealed the pure religious life to her. Those three spirits then knew that the wind spirit’s mind was gentle, gladdened, confident, pure, devoid of the hindrances, and easy to teach. According to the eternal way of buddhas, they taught the noble truth of suffering and the truths of suffering’s formation, suffering’s cessation, and suffering’s escape. They explained them broadly for her.
{:#p158}

159\. “The wind spirit became removed from dust and free of defilement [right there on her seat], and her vision of the Dharma was purified. The wind spirit was like white cloth that readily accepts a dye. Her faith was purified, and she attained the Dharma eye without any doubts. Attaining the reward of certainty, she didn’t fall to the unpleasant destinies, nor did she set out on some other path. Achieving fearlessness, she told the three spirits, ‘I now take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge in the Dharma, and take refuge in the Saṅgha. I won’t kill, steal, engage in sex, lie, or drink alcohol for the rest of my life. Permit me to become a laywoman in the correct Dharma.’”

##### On Clouds, Lightning, and Rain

160\. The Buddha told the monks, “There are four kinds of clouds. What are the four? The first is white-colored, the second is black-colored, the third is red-colored, and the fourth is crimson-colored. The white clouds have a large amount of earth element in them. The black clouds have a large amount of water element in them. The red clouds have a large among of fire element in them. The crimson clouds have a large among of wind element in them.
{:#p160}

161\. “Those clouds are sometimes five kilometers, ten kilometers, fifteen kilometers, twenty kilometers … 2,000 kilometers away from the Earth. The exception is right after the eon begins when the clouds go up to the Ābhāsvara Heaven.
{:#p161}

162\. “Lightning has four kinds. What are the four? Eastern lightning, which is called Body Light. Southern lightning, which is called Hard to Destroy. Western lightning, which is called Streaming Fire. Northern lightning, which is called Fixed Illumination.[\[12\]](#n12){:#ref12}
{:#p162}

163\. “Why are there these lightning flashes in the clouds and sky? Sometimes, Body Light and Hard to Destroy touch each other. Sometimes Body Light and Stream of Fire touch each other. Sometimes the Body Light and Fixed Illumination touch each other. Sometimes Hard to Destroy and Stream of Fire touch each other. Sometimes Hard to Destroy and Fixed Illumination touch each other. Sometimes Stream of Fire and Fixed Illumination touch each other. These are the reasons that there are lightning flashes in the sky and clouds.
{:#p163}

164\. “Again, why does the sound of thunder happen in the sky and clouds? Sometimes, the earth and water elements come into contact in the sky. Sometimes, the earth and fire elements come into contact. Sometimes, the earth and wind elements come into contact. Sometimes, the water and fire elements come into contact. Sometimes, the water and wind elements come into contact. These are the reasons the sound of thunder happens in the sky and clouds.
{:#p164}

165\. “There are five causes and conditions that make predicting rain uncertain and confuse forecasters. What are the five? First, the clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, the clouds are baked by too much fire element and don’t release rain. This is the first reason forecasters are mistaken.
{:#p165}

166\. “Second, the clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, a great wind rises that scatters the clouds in all four directions, blowing them into the mountains. This is the [second] reason forecasters are mistaken.
{:#p166}

167\. “Third, clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, a great asura approaches, disperses the clouds, and sends them over the ocean. This is the [third] reason forecasters are mistaken.
{:#p167}

168\. “Fourth, clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, the master of clouds and master of rain are careless and lustful, so they never release the rain. This is the [fourth] reason forecasters are mistaken.
{:#p168}

169\. “Fifth, clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, the world’s population behaves contrary to the Dharma. They carelessly do impure deeds, and they are stingy, jealous, and hold deluded views. This causes the heavens not to release its rain. This is the [fifth] reason forecasters are mistaken. These are the five causes and conditions for forecasters to be uncertain about rain.”

### Notes

1. {:#n1}This is Chapter 8 of <em>sūtra</em> no. 30 of the <cite>Dīrgha Āgama</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0001_p0131a03" target="_blank">T1.1.131a3-7a23</a>). [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2}<em>Pāruṣaka</em>. C. 麤澁, P. Phārusaka, S. Pāruṣaka. The C. translation means “rough,” which matches the meaning of S. paruṣa. Alternate C. sources agree on this meaning, and one (T 25) transliterates the name as paruṣa (波婁沙). S. Pāruṣa, on the other hand, is the name of a tree. This confusion might happen in Gandhari or Tocharian, which drop long vowels. As we’ll see below, DĀ 30 glosses the names of these parks as referring to the effects they have on the gods who visit them. [\[back\]](#ref2)
3. {:#n3}<em>Citraratha</em>. The Chinese translates the name as “Painting (畫) Pleasure (樂),” which translates S. citra-ratha literally. This agrees with the name of a Trāyastriṃśa park in S. and P. sources. [\[back\]](#ref3)
4. {:#n4}<em>Miśrakā</em>. C. 雜. The Chinese translates this name as “Mixed,” which matches the meaning of S. miśra. Miśrakāvana is the name of a Trāyastriṃśa park in S. and P. sources. [\[back\]](#ref4)
5. {:#n5}<em>Anusudarśana (?)</em>. C. 順善見. The Chinese translates the second seat’s name as “Following Good View.” Alternate Chinese translations of this passage render it as “Smaller Good View” (小善見). It must have been smaller, meant for a servant to sit on, perhaps. I’ve guessed that 順 translates the prefix S. anu-, but I’ve found no Indic parallels to use for confirmation. [\[back\]](#ref5)
6. {:#n6}<em>Nandana</em>. C. 大喜. The Chinese translates the park’s name as “Great Joy.” In P. and S. sources, a fourth Trāyastriṃśa park is called Nandana, which can mean “rejoicing.” [\[back\]](#ref6)
7. {:#n7}This list of ten names was transliterated to C. I’ve reconstructed it to possible Sanskrit equivalents. The first four names of this list are more certain than the remainder, which are only educated guesses. There are two other Chinese translations of the list, but after the fourth name, they vary widely with each other. There are no Indic parallels extant to my knowledge. [\[back\]](#ref7)
8. {:#n8}<em>maiden flowers</em>. C. 童女花. Presumably the Indic name of this flower was also a word for girls or young women, but it elludes me. [\[back\]](#ref8)
9. {:#n9}<em>Earth Sovereign gods</em>. C. 地自在天. This is not a standard class of gods that appear anywhere else in DĀ. An alternate Taisho reading changes it to read Paranirmitavaśavartin (他化自在天), but this doesn’t make sense coming after the Akaniṣṭha gods. I’ve left the passage as-is. [\[back\]](#ref9)
10. {:#n10}<em>cubits</em>. C. 肘. A cubit was an ancient measure of length, taking the average distance from a man’s elbow to the tip of his fingers. It varied from place to place but was approximately 18 inches (45.7 cm). [\[back\]](#ref10)
11. {:#n11}<em>Adornment gods</em>. C. 嚴飾天. This group of four heavens, which are the fourth dhyāna heavens in this list, appears unique. I’m not sure what the S. equivalent was, so I’ve translated it to English. [\[back\]](#ref11)
12. {:#n12}This passage has a couple alternate C. translations, but they vary widely from this version, and they are largely translated rather than transliterated. The original Indic is unclear, so I’ve translated the C. names literally. [\[back\]](#ref12)
