### 30. Description of the World
#### Chapter 1: The Continent of Jambudvīpa
##### Introduction

1\. Thus I have heard:[\[1\]](#n1){:#ref1} One time, the Buddha was staying in the Karīrika Hut in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park at Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a great assembly of 1,250 monks.
{:#p1}

2\. After their meal, a group of monks gathered up in the meeting hall. They had this discussion: “Gentlemen, it’s amazing! What causes the destruction of heaven and earth? What causes their formation? What are the countries where sentient beings live?”
{:#p2}

3\. The Bhagavān was in a quiet place at the time and overheard them clearly with his heavenly ear. He heard those monks saying this, having gathering up in the meeting hall after their meal. The Bhagavān then emerged from his quiet hut, went to the meeting hall, and sat down. Knowing it, he purposefully questioned them. He asked the monks, “You were having a discussion earlier. What was it that you were discussing?”
{:#p3}

4\. The monks said to the Buddha, “We gathered here in the meeting hall after our meal and discussed this: ‘Gentlemen, it’s amazing! What causes the destruction of heaven and earth? What causes their formation? What countries do sentient beings live in?’ This was what we were discussing after gathering here in the hall.”
{:#p4}

5\. The Buddha told the monks, “Good, good! Everyone who’s left home should practice two things: The first is the noble silence, and the second is [the noble] discussion of the Dharma. When all of you gather in a meeting hall, you should practice noble silence or [noble] discussion of the Dharma. Monks, would you like to hear the Tathāgata describe the formation and destruction of heaven and earth and the cities and countries where sentient beings live?”
The monks said to the Buddha, “Indeed, Bhagavān, now would be a good time! We’d be glad to hear it. Once the Bhagavān has explained this, we’ll remember it!”
{:#p5}

6\. The Buddha said, “Monks, listen closely! Listen closely and consider it well! I will explain it for you.”
{:#p6}

##### The Buddha Realm

7\. The Buddha told the monks, “Just as one sun and moon orbit the four continents and shine their light on them, there are a thousand such worlds.[\[2\]](#n2){:#ref2} In a thousand worlds, there are a thousand suns and moons, a thousand Sumeru mountain kings, four thousand continents, four thousand great continents, four thousand oceans, four thousand great oceans, four thousand nāgas, four thousand great nāgas, four thousand garuḍas, four thousand great garuḍas, four thousand unpleasant destinies, four thousand great unpleasant destinies, four thousand kings, four thousand great kings, seven thousand great trees, eight thousand great hells, ten thousand great mountains, a thousand King Yamas, a thousand four god kings, a thousand Trāyastriṃśa Heavens, a thousand Yama Heavens, a thousand Tuṣita Heavens, a thousand Nirmāṇarati Heavens, a thousand Paranirmitavaśavartin Heavens, and a thousand Brahma Heavens. This is a small thousand worlds.
{:#p7}

8\. “Like one small thousand worlds, a thousand of those small thousand worlds are a medium thousand worlds. Like one medium thousand worlds, a thousand of those medium thousand worlds are a triple-thousand great thousand worlds. Such worlds revolve around as they form and are destroyed. The sentient beings that inhabit them are called a single Buddha realm.”
{:#p8}

##### The World

9\. The Buddha told the monks, “Now, this Earth is 168,000 yojanas deep,[\[3\]](#n3){:#ref3} and its bounds are endless [in the four directions]. Where the earth stops, there’s water. The water is 3,030 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless. Where the water stops, there’s air. The air is 6,040 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless.
{:#p9}

10\. “Monks, the ocean’s water is 84,000 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless. Sumeru the mountain king is 84,000 yojanas in the water, and it rises to a height of 84,000 yojanas above the ocean. Below, it’s roots connect it to the earth with many hard points. That mountain goes straight up without any bends. All sorts of trees grow on it, and the trees produce many fragrances. The fragrances pervade the mountain’s forests. Many noble people, great spirits, and marvelous gods make their homes there. The foundation under that mountain is entirely gold sand. Four crags emerge from that mountain’s four sides that are 700 yojanas high with a mixture of colors throughout and made of the seven treasures. Those four crags are slanted, leaning precariously over the ocean.
{:#p10}

11\. “Sumeru the mountain king has stairways made of the seven treasures. At the bottom, the stairways are sixty yojanas wide. On both sides, the path is bordered by a seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees.

12\. “The gold walls have silver gates, the silver walls have gold gates, the crystal walls have beryl gates, the beryl walls have crystal gates, the ruby walls have emerald gates, the emerald walls have ruby gates, and the coral walls have gates made of many treasures.

{:#p15}

16\. “Each of the seven walls has four gates. The gates have balustrades, and towers and terraces are above the seven walls. They’re surrounded by scenic parks and lakes where myriad precious flowers and plants grow. The rows of treasure trees are full with flowers and fruit, and they produce fragrances that blow in the four directions to the delight of passersby. Ducks, geese, cakras, and other rare kinds of birds in countless thousands sing peacefully to each other.
{:#p16}

17\. “Furthermore, halfway up Sumeru the mountain king, the stairways are forty yojanas wide. On both sides, the path is bordered by seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees … Countless birds of many kinds sing peacefully to each other as they do at the lower stairways.
{:#p17}

18\. “At the top of Sumeru the mountain king, the stairways are twenty yojanas wide. On both sides, the path is bordered by seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees … Countless birds of many kinds sing peacefully to each other as they do at the middle stairways.”
{:#p18}

19\. The Buddha told the monks, “There are yakṣa spirits that live on the lower stairway called Karoṭapāṇi. The yakṣa spirits that live on the middle stairway are called Mālādhāra. The yakṣa spirits that live on the upper stairway are called Sadāmada.
{:#p19}

##### The Heavens

20\. “The four crags rise to a height of 42,000 yojanas, and the four great god kings live on them in their palaces.

25\. “Above the Akaniṣṭha Heaven are the gods who cognize the abode of space … the gods who cognize the abode of consciousness … the gods who cognize the abode of nothingness … the gods who cognize the abode with and without conception.
{:#p25}

26\. “These are called the boundaries of sentient beings and the worlds of sentient beings where they all are born, grow old, fall ill, and die. They acquire these aggregates and these existences, and none go beyond that.”
{:#p26}

##### The Meaning of “Anavatapta”

69\. The Buddha said, “Why is it called Anavatapta? What’s the meaning of ‘Anavatapta’? Here in Jambudvīpa, there’s a nāga king who stopped having three troubles. Only the nāga Anavatapta has none of these three troubles. What are the three?
{:#p69}

70\. “First, all the nāgas throughout Jambudvīpa suffer from hot winds and hot sand that cling to their bodies and burn their skin and flesh. It even burns their bones and marrow, causing them misery. Only the nāga Anavatapta doesn’t have this trouble.
{:#p70}

71\. “Second, all the nāga palaces throughout Jambudvīpa have fierce winds that blow through them. They lose their treasure-decorated clothes, and their nāga bodies are left exposed, which causes them misery. Only the Nāga King Anavatapta doesn’t have this trouble.
{:#p71}

72\. “Third, when all the nāga kings throughout Jambudvīpa entertain themselves in their respective palaces, great garuḍa birds take the opportunity to snatch them or their newly born, for they like to eat nāgas. The nāgas are afraid of them and always feel distressed about this. Only the nāga Anavatapta doesn’t have this trouble.
{:#p72}

73\. If the garuḍa birds decide to go there, their lives end. Therefore, it’s called Anavatapta (Anavatapta in Chinese means ‘No Distress’).”
{:#p73}

74\. The Buddha told the monks, “On the right side of Mount Himavat, there’s a city named Vaiśālī. That city has seven black mountains to its north. North of those seven black mountains, there’s a fragrance mountain. There are always sounds of music and singing at that mountain. It has two caves: One is called Painted and the second is called Skillfully Painted.[\[5\]](#n5){:#ref5} They’re made of seven heavenly treasures that are soft and pleasant smelling like heavenly cloth. The Gandharva King Sarasvatī lives there with 500 gandharvas.
{:#p74}

##### The Elephant King Susaṃsthita

75\. “North of the caves Painted and Skillfully Painted is a sal tree king named Susaṃsthita. It’s surrounded on four sides by 8,000 other tree kings.

His head is red and his hair is multicolored. His six tusks are delicate, and there’s gold between them. He’s surrounded by 8,000 elephants that follow him.

### Notes

1. {:#n1}This is Chapter 1 of <em>sūtra</em> no. 30 of the <cite>Dīrgha Āgama</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0001_p0114b07" target="_blank">T1.1.114b7-7c12</a>).This <em>sūtra</em> does not have a direct parallel with any Pali <em>sutta</em>, but various passages and stories that it collects are found in Pali <em>sutta</em>s and paracanonical sources. The closest parallels to the entire text are the <em>Lokaprajñapti</em> of the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma (which exists in Tibetan) and the Pali version of the same called the <em>Lokapaññatti</em>. [\[back\]](#ref1)
2. {:#n2}The author(s) of this text envisioned the Earth as a flat plane, and the world as a circle bounded by a ring of mountains with Mount Sumeru at its center. This was not a universal belief in the ancient world, however. Ancient Greeks believed the world was spherical as early as 500 BCE because they believed a sphere was the perfect shape. Later Greeks noticed clues that the Earth is round such as the rounded shadow cast on the moon during eclipses and that different constellations are visible from different latitudes. Eratosthenes appears to have been the first person to accurately calculate the Earth’s circumference in 240 BCE. [\[back\]](#ref2)
3. {:#n3}<em>yojana</em>. A yojana is an ancient Indian unit of distance similar to a league. Like most ancient units of measurement, there was no exact value. Depending on its local definition, one <em>yojana</em> usually ranged from 7 to 9 miles (11.25 to 14.5 km), or about twice the distance of a league. Thus, 168,000 <em>yojana</em>s would be approximately 1,344,000 miles (2,162,958 km).<br/>
I’ve left <em>yojana</em> untranslated so that the reader can see the original numbers, but it should be understood that a thousand <em>yojana</em>s is a very large distance. To give some perspective, we know today that the Earth is a sphere with a circumference of about 3,100 <em>yojana</em>s and a radius of 500 <em>yojana</em>s, and the Moon is about 30,000 <em>yojana</em>s away from the Earth. [\[back\]](#ref3)
4. {:#n4}This list of thirty-five forests isn’t found in other sources, and some of the names are obscure. Reconstructions I’m somewhat confident about are marked with \*, and those that are guesses are marked with (?). Some are translated to Chinese, which I translate to English. [\[back\]](#ref4)
5. {:#n5}<em>Painted … Skillfully Painted</em>. The present text reads 晝 and 善晝, which would mean “Day” and “Good Day.” An alternate Chinese translation has instead “mixed colors” and “skillfully mixed colors.” If 晝 is a typo for 畫, then the original passage would read “Painting” and “Good Painting,” which would agree with the alternate version.
