    <td id='p2'>2. It was the fifteenth-day full moon when the Bhagavān sat in an open area with the assembly of monks both in front and behind him.

They aren’t sleepy yet, but I’m suffering from back pain. I’d like to take a break for a while. Perhaps you can explain the Dharma for the monks now?”</td>

    <td id='p4'>4. Śāriputra then addressed the monks, “Now, here in this city of Pāpā, it hasn’t been long since Nirgrantha Jñātaputra’s life ended. Since then, his disciples have split into two factions that constantly argue and look for shortcomings to reproach each other. They contradict each other, saying: ‘I know this teaching.’ ‘You don’t know this.’ ‘You hold wrong views.’ ‘I hold to the right teaching.’ ‘Their words are confused and without proper order.’ They consider statements praising themselves to be true, saying: ‘My statement is the winner; your words are defeated.

As a result, they consider their teaching to be untrue. A teaching that’s untrue has no way to escape, just as a ruined shrine cannot be repainted. It’s not the teaching of a completely awakened one.

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ol class="notes-list">
<li id="n1"><p>This is <em>sūtra</em> no. 9 of the <cite>Dīrgha Āgama</cite> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0001_p0049b26" target="_blank">T1.1.49b26-52c11</a>). Its direct parallels are <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn33" target="_blank">DN 33</a> and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T0012_001" target="_blank">T12</a>. We should also note that there’s substantial overlap with <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn34" target="_blank">DN 34</a>, <a href="DA_10.html" target="_blank">DĀ 10</a>, <a href="DA_11.html" target="_blank">DĀ 11</a>, and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T0013_001" target="_blank">T13</a>. All of these <em>sūtra</em>s collect teachings into numerically organized lists. [<a href="#ref1">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n2"><p><em>Pāpā</em>. C. <span class="ch">波婆</span> (MC. pua-b’ua), P. <em>pāvā</em>, S. <em>pāpā</em>. I’ve adopted the S. attestation, but the Chinese transliteration matches the Pali in this case. [<a href="#ref2">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n3"><p><em>All sentient beings are reborn as a result of their actions.</em> C. <span class="ch">一切眾生皆由行往</span>. There is an alternate reading of this line in the Ming edition that substitutes <span class="ch">住</span> for <span class="ch">往</span>, which would indeed more closely match S. <em>sarvasatvāḥ saṃskārasthāyinaḥ</em>. The Japanese translators chose to amend the <cite>Taisho</cite> text here, but I’m less convinced given how often DĀ diverges from later S. and P. sources. If I were to amend <span class="ch">往</span> to <span class="ch">住</span>, the passage would read “All sentient beings abide as a result of their actions.” The difference is not great; both readings point to the conditioned genesis of beings. [<a href="#ref3">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n4"><p><em>emptiness … no aspirations … no signs</em>. The order of these three <em>samādhi</em>s differs from that found in DĀ 10, DĀ 11, and DĀ 12, switching the usual position of the second and third <em>samādhi</em>s. The translation of the <em>samādhi</em> without aspirations also differs from the other three <em>sūtra</em>s passages, which instead translate it as “no action” (<span class="ch">無作</span>). This appears to be an inconsistency internal to DĀ, perhaps a translator or copyist error, until we notice that the same order occurs in a Song translation of a different <cite>Saṅgīti Sūtra</cite> (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T01n0012_p0228a19" target="_blank">T12.228a19ff</a>). So, this appears to represent a different version of the three <em>samādhi</em>s.</p>
<p>We also find the <em>samādhi</em> of no aspirations translated as it’s found here in the <em>Śāriputra Abhidharma</em> (ŚāA), but there the order is the usual one (i.e., emptiness, no signs, and no aspirations).</p>
<p>In ŚāA, these three <em>samādhi</em>s are presented as advanced meditations. E.g., they are placed after the <em>samādhi</em>s with both <em>vitarka</em> and <em>vicāra</em>, with only <em>vicāra</em>, and without either <em>vitarka</em> and <em>vicāra</em>, which are another way of categorizing the four meditations (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0598c18" target="_blank">T1548.28.598c18</a>), and they are analyzed as not being associated with ignorant contacts, whereas the other three <em>samādhi</em>s are. While there is no commentary or discussion of these <em>samādhi</em> in DĀ, there is an explanation of their meanings in ŚāA, which I’ve summarized in separate notes below. [<a href="#ref4">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n5"><p>samādhi <em>of empiness.</em> C. <span class="ch">空三昧</span>, P. <em>suññato samādhi</em>, S. <em>śūnyatā-samādhi</em>. The commentary for this <em>samādhi</em> in ŚāA is found at <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0633a08" target="_blank">T1548.28.633a8-b4</a>. It reads: “What is the <em>samādhi</em> of emptiness? Here, a monk contemplates, knows, understands, and gets that ‘all things or a thing in a single location are empty. What does it mean that they are empty? Because they are empty of self, what belongs to self is also empty.’ Carefully observing them in this way, he obtains <em>samādhi</em>, and his mind abides in the proper abode. This is called the <em>samādhi</em> of emptiness.” (<span class="ch">何謂空定？如比丘，一切法、若一處法，思惟空、知空、解空、受空。以何義空？以我空，我所亦空。如是不放逸觀，得定心住正住，是名空定。</span>)</p>
<p>The remainder of the commentary explains emptiness in six different ways: Internal emptiness, external emptiness, both internal and external emptiness, emptiness of emptiness, great emptiness, and emptiness of the supreme truth.</p>
<p>Internal, external, and both internal and external emptiness are explained as contemplating all internal things, all external things, or all things that are internal or external as empty.</p>
<p>The emptiness of emptiness refers to the recognition that accomplishing the <em>samādhi</em> of emptiness is itself empty.</p>
<p>The great emptiness is explained in the same way as the <em>samādhi</em> of emptiness was above.</p>
<p>Emptiness of the supreme truth is explained this way: “What is the emptiness of the supreme truth? ‘Supreme’ refers to <em>nirvāṇa</em>. Here, a monk contemplates the emptiness of <em>nirvāṇa</em>, knowing, understanding, and getting its emptiness. Why is it empty? Because it’s empty of self, it’s also empty of what belongs to self, empty of permanence, and empty of unchangingness. Carefully observing it in this way, he obtains <em>samādhi</em>, and his mind abides in the proper abode. This is called the <em>samādhi</em> of supreme truth.” (<span class="ch">何謂第一義空？第一謂涅槃。如比丘思惟涅槃空、知空、解空、受空。以何義空？以我空，我所亦空，常空、不變易空。如是不放逸觀，得定心住正住，是名第一義空。</span>) [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p>samādhi <em>of no aspirations.</em>. C. <span class="ch">無願三昧</span>, P. <em>appaṇihito samādhi</em>, S. <em>apraṇihitaṃ ca samādhi</em>. The commentary for this <em>samādhi</em> in ŚāA is found at <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0633b11" target="_blank">T1548.28.633b11-16</a>. It reads: “What is the <em>samādhi</em> of no aspirations? Aside from the <em>samādhi</em> of emptiness, whatever other <em>samādhi</em> that takes the noble conditioning as its domain is called the <em>samādhi</em> of no aspirations. Furthermore, the <em>samādhi</em> of no aspirations is regarding two kinds of aspiration: Attachment to cravings and attachment to views. A monk contemplates actions as painful, troublesome, abcesses, arrows, attachments, and enjoyment based and conditioned on things that erode, are uncertain, insufficient, destructible, and painful in many ways. While not contemplating the selflessness of emptiness, he obtains <em>samādhi</em>, and his mind abides in the proper abode. The monk stops craving and stops views.” (<span class="ch">何謂無願定？除空定，若餘定，以聖有為為境界，是名無願定。復次無願定，願有二種：愛著、見著。比丘思惟行苦、患、癰、箭、著、味，依緣壞法、不定、不足、可壞、眾苦。不思惟空無我，得定心住正住。比丘愛斷見斷，此定能斷愛見，是名無願定。</span>) [<a href="#ref6">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n7"><p>samādhi <em>of no signs</em>. C. <span class="ch">無相三昧</span>, P. <em>animitto samādhi</em>, S. <em>animitta samādhi</em>. The commentary for this <em>samādhi</em> in ŚāA is found at <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0633b04" target="_blank">T1548.28.633b4-11</a>. It reads: “What is the <em>samādhi</em> of no signs? Aside from the <em>samādhi</em> of emptiness, whatever other <em>samādhi</em> that takes the noble conditioning as its domain is called the <em>samādhi</em> of no signs. Furthermore, actions have signs and <em>nirvāṇa</em> has no signs in the <em>samādhi</em> of no signs. Actions have three signs, arising, subsisting, and ceasing. <em>Nirvāṇa</em> lacks these three signs; it doesn’t arise, subsist, or cease. In this way, actions have signs and <em>nirvāṇa</em> has no signs. <em>Nirvāṇa</em> is peace, shelter, protection, a bright lamp, support, something that never subsides, a refuge, something without burning heat, something without grief, something without grief, lamentation, pain, and trouble, or any other actions. Contemplating <em>nirvāṇa</em>, a monk obtains <em>samādhi</em>, and his mind abides in the proper abode. This is called the <em>samādhi</em> of no signs.” (<span class="ch">何謂無相定？除空定，若餘定，以聖涅槃為境界，是名無相定。復次無相定，行有相、涅槃無相。行有三相，生、住、滅。涅槃無三相，不生、不住、不滅。如是行有相、涅槃無相，涅槃是寂滅、是舍宅、是救護、是燈明、是依止、是不終沒、是歸趣、是無燋熱、是無憂惱、是無憂悲苦惱及餘諸行。思惟涅槃得定心住正住。是名無相定。</span>) [<a href="#ref7">back</a>]</p></li>
