He teaches that ignorance conditions action … <em>up to</em> … birth conditions old age and death. If one accords with this principle, that is the case, not something otherwise.

<p>For this paragraph, the passage at 655c5 makes clear that omissions were made. It reads: <span class="ch">或有人緣過去疑：「惑我過去有、我過去非有？何姓我過去有？何因我過去有？」若緣未來疑惑：「我未來有、我未來非有？何姓我未來有？何因我未來有？」若緣現在疑惑：「我現在有、我現在非有？何姓現在有？何因現在有？諸眾生從何處來、去至何處？」</span></p>

<li id="n5"><p><em>who see independently others</em>. C. <span class="ch">異緣實</span>, P. <em>aparappaccaya</em>. This expression occurs in several similar passages of the <cite>Śāriputra Abhidharma</cite> that depict a non-Buddhist making assertions of truth that are considered wrong views.</p>
<p>I’ve amended <span class="ch">實</span> to <span class="ch">見</span> based on a parallel passage for this list of views quoted in the next note. This makes much better sense and matches the <em>sūtra</em> passages that list out the wrong views of non-Buddhists, like those found in DĀ 21.</p>
<p>The Indic equivalent of <span class="ch">異緣</span> is not clear to me. It would seem to directly translate S. <em>para-pratyaya</em> or <em>apara-pratyaya</em>. The first would match a very rare term in Pali sources (P. <em>parappacchaya</em>) which would mean “relying on others.” The second would be P. <em>aparappacchaya</em>, which is a more common term that means “independent of others.” This latter reading would serve as a succinct way of saying that these non-Buddhists arrive at these views through their own recollection of past lives or reasoning. I have opted for that reading in my translation. [<a href="#ref5">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n6"><p>This list of views has been abbreviated in this passage, but there is a full list of them in another passage that reads: “Self and world are eternal … not eternal … both eternal and not eternal … neither eternal nor not eternal … self and world are limited … unlimited … both limited and unlimited … neither limited nor unlimited … the body is the soul … the soul is the body … the body is one thing and the soul another … there is no soul or body … there are thus gone ones who have been extinguished … no thus gone ones … there are and aren’t thus gone ones … there neither are thus gone ones nor no thus gone ones who have been extinguished …” (<span class="ch">或有沙門婆羅門異緣見：「我世常，此見實餘虛妄。我世非常，此實餘虛妄。我世常非常，此實餘虛妄。我世非常非非常，此實餘虛妄。我世有邊，此實餘虛妄。我世無邊，此實餘虛妄。我世有邊無邊，此實餘虛妄。我世非有邊非無邊，此實餘虛妄。身是命，此實餘虛妄。命是身，此實餘虛妄。身異命異，此實餘虛妄。無命無身，此實餘虛妄。有如去涅槃，此實餘虛妄。無如去涅槃，此實餘虛妄。有如去不如去涅槃，此實餘虛妄。(非)有如去非不如去涅槃，此實餘虛妄。」</span>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0588c06" target="_blank">T1548.28.588c6-16</a>.)</p>

It matches the SĀ version better than the other two versions.

<li id="n8"><p>This third paragraph about the “method of conditionality” is not found in the other extant <em>sūtra</em> parallels. It does, however, explain the title of DĀ 13, which is differs with the title given to DN 15 and MĀ 97. [<a href="#ref8">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n9"><p>This definition of ignorance is deceptively simple. Elsewhere in the <cite>Śāriputra Abhidharma</cite>, we find a much longer definition of delusion:</p>
<p>“What is the unskillful root of delusion? Ignorance is the unskillful root of delusion. What is the unskillful root of delusion? It is not knowing suffering, its formation, its cessation, or the path; not knowing the past, not knowing the future, and not knowing the past and future; not knowing the internal, not knowing the external, and not knowing the internal and external; not knowing the six senses of contact, their formation, their cessation, their enjoyment, their trouble, and their escape; not knowing what is such and so; not knowing the consequences of deeds; not knowing what’s skillful, unskillful, or indeterminate; what’s black or white; when there’s conditioning or no conditioning; when there’s light or not light; what’s done and not done; or who’s a friend or not a friend. Suppose one is deluded about those things with degraded or prohibited thoughts, blocked, veiled, and covered by darkness, with uncultivated, defiled, and ensnaring thoughts, being deluded, muddied, and ignorant, the flood of ignorance, depths of ignorance, and tendency of ignorance, lacking knowledge, lacking vision, lacking understanding, lacking freedom, and lacking method. Suppose one is also deluded about any other subject with degraded or prohibited thoughts, blocked, veiled, and covered by darkness … <em>up to</em> … lacking knowledge, lacking vision, lacking understanding, lacking freedom, and lacking method. This is called the unskillful root of delusion.” (<span class="ch">云何癡不善根？無明是名癡不善根。云何癡不善根？不知苦、集、滅、道；不知過去、不知未來、不知過去未來；不知內、不知外、不知內外；[不知]六觸入⋯集⋯滅⋯味⋯過患⋯不知如實出；不知如、爾；不知業報；不知緣善、不善、無記；黑、白；有緣、無緣；有光、無光；作、不作；親、不親。彼法中若癡，奪心、應奪心，礙、覆、蓋暗冥，荒、穢、纏心，癡濁、無明，無明流、無明淵、無明使，無知、無見、無解、無脫、無方便。及餘法中癡若癡奪心、應奪心、礙、覆、蓋闇冥⋯乃至⋯無知、無見、無解、無脫、無方便。名癡不善根。</span> <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0570b16" target="_blank">T1548.28.570b16-27</a>).</p>
<p>This definition is very similar to the longer definitions of ignorance found in both Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma. The other commentaries on dependent origination agree that the concept of ignorance is interchangeable with delusion. One might wonder which term came first and whether there was originally a difference in meaning. It may be that the importance of insight (S. <em>vidyā</em>, P. <em>vijjā</em>) in the descriptions of Buddhist awakening begged the question as to what its opposite (<em>avidyā</em>) represented. The answer was that ignorance was actually the root of delusion.</p>
<p>This equation is probably the reason why we find delusion in the place of ignorance of the twelve-link chain listed at the beginning of <a href="../../01_agama/dirgha/DA_13.html#p5" target="_blank">DĀ 13</a>. While non-standard compared to other sources, the intended meaning is not changed in any way. The two words were considered the same by the Dharmaguptaka school. [<a href="#ref9">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n10"><p>This is the same definition of actions conditioned by ignorance that we find in the Sarvāstivāda and Theravāda commentaries. They all source this definition from an EBT, three versions of which are still extant: <a href="../../01_agama/samyukta/03/SA3_10.html" target="_blank">SĀ 3.10 (292)</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.51/en/sujato" target="_blank">SN 12.51</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sf159" target="_blank">SF159</a>.</p>
<p>We should note, however, that C. <span class="ch">行</span> (“actions”) likely translates an equivalent of S. <em>saṃskāra</em> (P. <em>saṅkhara</em>) here, which is interpreted differently depending on the tradition. It was interpreted narrowly to be mean “volition” or “intention” in Theravāda sources. We can see from the C. translation here and the commentary that follows that it was understood more broadly as intentional actions along the lines of the path of good and bad deeds, the four meditations, and the four formless <em>samādhi</em>s. We will also see that these actions were considered to condition both present life awareness and the awareness of the next life upon rebirth. [<a href="#ref10">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n11"><p>This definition is the usual form of the path of ten unskillful deeds, which is the type of <em>karma</em> that leads to rebirth in the lower realms (hell, animal, and hungry ghost).</p>
<p>Unlike the <em>Vibhaṅga</em> commentary, there is no attempt to force a meaning of intention to do physical, verbal, and mental deeds onto S. <em>saṃsakāra</em>, which has been translated as C. <span class="ch">行</span>. A person could be forgiven for thinking <span class="ch">行</span> might have translated a word like S. <em>karma</em> or <em>carita</em> here. That is not likely, but <em>saṃsakāra</em> does not appear to be read as a member of the aggregates. A less technical reading of “forming” or “accomplishing” with <em>karma</em> specifically in mind fits the passage better. I have simply translated the Chinese as “action,” which is the basic meaning of <span class="ch">行</span> in any case. [<a href="#ref11">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n12"><p>The practice of ten good deeds is the type of <em>karma</em> that leads to rebirth among humans or in a desire realm heaven. [<a href="#ref12">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n13"><p><em>unexpressed.</em> C. <span class="ch">無教</span>, P. <em>aviññatti</em>, S. <em>avijñapti</em>. This C. translation occurs in the same context in a few passages of Xuanzang’s Abhidharma translations, where the S. equivalent was <em>avijñapti</em> (“unexpressed” or “unannounced”). The intended meaning was that the physical or verbal deed is only thought or imagined in the mind. Doing such a deed was like announcing or making known the intention to do it to others who observe it.</p>
<p>There is also a passage found at <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0581a17" target="_blank">T1548.28.581a17-22</a> that explains what <span class="ch">無教</span> means in the context of deeds: “What are expressed deeds? Physical and verbal deeds are called expressed deeds. What are unexpressed deeds? Mental deeds are unexpressed deeds. What are physical deeds with expression? If a physical deed consists of the form sense, it’s called a physical deed with expression. What are physical deeds without expression? If a physical deed consists of the idea sense, it’s called a physical deed without expression. What are verbal deeds with expression? If a verbal deed consists of the sound sense, it’s called a verbal deed with expression. What are verbal deeds without expression? If a verbal deed consists of the idea sense, it’s called a verbal deed without expression” (<span class="ch">云何教業？身業、口業是名教業。云何無教業？意業是名無教業。云何身[有]教業？若身業色入攝，是名身[有]教業。云何身無教業？若身業法入攝，是名身無教業。云何口[有]教業？若口業聲入攝，是名口[有]教業。云何口無教業？若口業法入攝，是名口無教業。</span> <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0581a17" target="_blank">T1548.28.581a17-22</a>)</p>
<p>It’s of interest to note that these physical and verbal deeds that consist of the idea sense (<em>dharma āyātana</em>) were still considered to be form (<em>rūpa</em>). Cases like these were the reason the idea sense was typically defined as consisting of both form and formless things. This shows that <em>rūpa</em> referred to visual imagery as its primary meaning before it became common for it to refer to the physical body vs. the mind in terms like name and form (<em>nāmarūpa</em>). We will see more evidence of this below in the commentary on name and form, which includes both readings of form.</p>
<p>It’s also of interest to notice that all of the meditations and formless <em>samādhi</em>s below are described as consisting of unexpressed physical and verbal actions in addition to mental actions. We might infer from this that these practices were considered to involve visualizations and subvocal speech. This will be the case for all of the meditations below. [<a href="#ref13">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n14"><p>The practice of the four meditations (P. <em>jhāna</em>, S. <em>dhyāna</em>) are included as the type of <em>karma</em> that leads to rebirth in one of the form realm heavens. [<a href="#ref14">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n15"><p>These practices of formless <em>samādhi</em> were considered the type of <em>karma</em> that leads to rebirth in one of the formless realm heavens. [<a href="#ref15">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n16"><p><em>causes, origins, and conditions.</em> C. <span class="ch">因、緒、緣</span>, S. <em>hetu nidāna pratyaya</em>?. This C. expression, which only occurs in this chapter of the <cite>Śāriputra Abhidharma</cite>, appears to translate three synonyms, presumably S. <em>hetu</em>, <em>nidāna</em>, and <em>pratyaya</em>. The unusual term here is <span class="ch">緒</span>, which lit. meant “the tip of a thread,” especially the tip of a thread of silk pulled from a caterpillar coccoon, which can consist of a single thread over a 1,000 feet long. Thus, <span class="ch">緒</span> came to mean the beginning of long-lasting things like historical eras or trends. As such, it lent itself well as a translation of <em>nidāna</em>, which also typically means an distant origin or historical background. [<a href="#ref16">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n17"><p><em>Thus, Ānanda, being asked, ‘What is the condition of actions?’ the answer is ‘Ignorance conditions actions.’ This is the answer.</em> C. <span class="ch">如是，阿難，問已有答：『行何緣？』『無明緣行，』此是答。</span> This translation in C. is awkward reading because it appears to follow the literal word order of the Indic original, which is not natural in C. For example, <span class="ch">有答</span> would normally mean “there is an answer,” but the P. parallel in DN 15 reads <em>atthītissa vacanīyaṁ</em>, which means “You should answer, ‘There is.’” The question also fails to match this answer, being “What conditions actions?” rather than “Is there a condition for actions?” I’ve translated the C. as naturally as possible.</p>
<p>This <em>sūtra</em> quote appears to be part of a passage at the beginning of <a href="../../01_agama/dirgha/DA_13.html#p15" target="_blank">DĀ 13</a>. The Buddha there tells Ānanda how to answer questions about the origin of each item in the chain of dependent origination, laying out the entire chain in reverse from suffering back to ignorance. Each section of this commentary will conclude with a similar quote from the same passage or one very much like it.</p>
<p>The other parallels to DĀ 13 do not present the twelve-link chain in this way. DN 15 features a chain that ends with awareness and name and form being mutually dependent. MĀ 97 only goes back to craving before moving on to the next section of the discourse. T14 agrees with MĀ 97. This serves as another bit of confirmation that the <cite>Śāriputra Abhidharma</cite> was part of the Dharmaguptaka canon (or one very similar to it). [<a href="#ref17">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n18"><p>This section is interesting in that it gives us a different context for action (S. <em>saṃskāra</em>) besides karmic action. Instead, here the action involved is the action of the sensory faculties in the normal course of their operation, as well as other mental functions like the unskillful and skillful roots. They represent the immediately antecedent conditions that determine the type of awareness that arises by providing the object for that awareness. In this usage, would might translate <span class="ch">行</span> as process or activity, but I’ve opted to maintain a single translation throughout. [<a href="#ref18">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n19"><p>These eight types of conditioning are a subset of ten types defined elsewhere in the <cite>Śāriputra Abhidharma</cite> (see below). Parallel lists of causal conditioning are found in later Buddhist literature, mainly in Abhidharma and Mahāyāna <em>sūtra</em>s, which served the purpose of discerning causal relationships more precisely. See, for example, the late era Theravāda list of twenty-four conditions summarized in <cite>The Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma</cite> (Bodhi et al, pp. 303-324), some of which are further subdivided into more types of conditioning. Similar lists of varying sizes are found in other sources. Early versions were quite short: a list of four types of conditioning is referenced occasionally in Mahāyāna texts (e.g., in Prajñāparāmitā texts, cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T06n0220_p0987c08" target="_blank">T220.6.987c8</a>). This early list apparently grew steadily as Abhidharma compilers made it more and more comprehensive.</p>
<p>This paragraph in our text is repeated again at <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0628c09" target="_blank">T1548.28.628c9</a>. There, it serves as a contemplation included among a long list of exercises collected under the mindfulness of body rubric. It reads: <span class="ch">復次，比丘如是思惟：「若最後行未知而滅、若無間行滅已，識續餘道生，彼行緣彼識，名無間緣。若因行彼識續餘道生，彼行緣彼識，名因緣。若思惟行識續餘道生，彼行緣彼識，名緣緣。若依行識續餘道生，彼行緣彼識，名依緣。若報行識續餘道生，彼行緣彼識，名報緣。若行起識續餘道生，彼行緣行識，名起緣。若相應行識續餘道生，彼行緣彼識，名異緣。若增上趣彼識增上續餘道生，彼行緣彼識，名增上緣。此最後識滅，初識續餘道生。</span></p>
<p>As already mentioned, these eight types of conditioning are defined in a later passage discussing a set of ten types in the <cite>Śāriputra Abhidharma</cite> (cf. <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0679b07" target="_blank">T1548.28.679b7</a>). These ten types of conditioning include the more familiar four conditions that we find in many other later Buddhist sources: causal conditioning (<span class="ch">因緣</span>, S. <em>hetu-pratyaya</em>), immediate conditioning (<span class="ch">無間緣</span>, <em>anantara-pratyaya</em>), objective conditioning (<span class="ch">境界緣</span>, S. <em>ārambaṇa-pratyaya</em>), and developmental (or predominant) conditioning (<span class="ch">增上緣</span>, <em>adhipati-pratyaya</em>).</p>
<p>To these, six more were added: supportive conditioning (<span class="ch">依緣</span>, <em>niśraya-pratyaya</em>), karmic conditioning (<span class="ch">業緣</span>, S. <em>karma-pratyaya</em>), consequential conditioning (<span class="ch">報緣</span>, S. <em>vipāka-pratyaya</em>), productive conditioning (<span class="ch">起緣</span>, S. <em>upaniśraya</em>?), other conditioning (<span class="ch">異緣</span>, S. <em>para-pratyaya</em>?), and continuous conditioning (<span class="ch">相續緣</span>, S. <em>samanantara-pratyaya</em>).</p>
<p>Below are definitions provided for the types cited in this passage:</p>
<p><em>immediate conditioning</em>. C. <span class="ch">無間緣</span>, S. <em>nirantara</em> or <em>samanantara-pratyaya</em>. This term lit. means “immediate” or “uninterrupted conditioning.” This refers to something that conditions something else that immediately follows it after it ceasing. In the case of this passage, this means that the final action before death conditions the awareness of the first moment in the next life, which follows it immediately. This action is not the cause for that awareness to arise, but it does condition it.</p>
<p>The definition provided in ŚāA only tells us that the immediate condition is something that has ceased. It reads: “If something arises and ceases, this is called an immediate condition. Furthermore, an immediate condition is, whether something has ceased or has yet to cease, one of the aggregates, elements, or senses, each of which of has its intrinsic nature when it arises. If it has already ceased in the present, this is called the immediate condition.” (<span class="ch">若法生滅，是名無間緣。復次，無間緣，若法已滅、若未滅，若陰、界、入法各自性即生，若先已滅於現在，是名無間緣。</span> <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0679b14" target="_blank">T1548.28.679b14</a>).</p>
<p><em>causal conditioning</em>. C. <span class="ch">因緣</span>, S. <em>hetu-pratyaya</em>. This refers to the primary cause for something to come about. In this passage, it would be the karmic action that resulted in the next rebirth. That action could have happened in a past life or the present one.</p> 
<p>The definition for causal conditioning provided in ŚāA reads: “If something is the cause, this is called causal conditioning. Furthermore, the causal condition is called a causal condition when it has a consequence, whether or not something else goes along with it. Furthermore, the causal condition has a consequence, whether or not there is something else that conditions it. Aside from the effect it obtains, if other things are unconditioned, good consequences, or the four elements, this is called causal conditioning” (<span class="ch">若法因，是名因緣。復次因緣，若法共、非共，有報，是名因緣。復次因緣，若法有緣、若法無緣，有報。除得果，若餘法無緣、善報、及四大，是名因緣。</span> <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0679b10" target="_blank">T1548.28.679b10</a>).</p>
<p><em>objective conditioning</em>. C. <span class="ch">境界緣</span>, S. <em>ārambaṇa-pratyaya</em>. The C. translation <span class="ch">境界</span> lit. means “sphere, domain, world.” In practice, it usually refers to the field of sensory objects that fill the environment, or one object in particular. Objective conditioning refers to all the things that serve as the background setting for an event that is brought about. Altogether, they define the situation that conditions the event, so to speak.</p>
<p>The definition for objective conditioning provided in ŚāA reads: “All things are objective conditions, just as signs give rise to thoughts and mental objects. This is called objective conditioning” (<span class="ch">一切法境界緣，如相生心心數法，是名境界緣。</span> <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0679b17" target="_blank">T1548.28.679b17</a>)</p>
<p><em>supportive condition</em>. C. <span class="ch">依緣</span>, S. <em>niśraya-pratyaya</em>. These are supporting conditions that are required for something to come about but do not necessarily cause it. For example, one must have a functional physical body to perform physical deeds; therefore, the body is a supporting condition for physical deeds.</p>
<p>The definition for supportive conditioning provided in ŚāA reads: “What is called supportive conditioning? If something has a dependency, this is called a supportive conditioning. Furthermore, supportive conditioning is if something supports the arising of another thing, then this thing is the supporting condition for that thing. The body is the support for physical deeds, the mouth is the support for verbal deeds, and the mind is the support for mental deeds. The four elements are supports for physical, verbal, and mental deeds. Earth is a support for farming, seeds, sentient beings, villages, plants, and forests. Bad friends are a support for the arising of bad and unskillful qualities. Good friends are a support for the arising of good qualities. The eye is a support and form is a support for the arising of visual awareness and things associated with visual awareness. The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise. Internal elements support the arising of internal elements, external elements, and internal and external elements. External elements support the arising of internal elements, external elements, and internal and external elements. Internal and external elements are supports for the arising of internal elements, external elements, and internal and external elements. Cessation is likewise. These are called supporting conditions” (<span class="ch">何謂依緣？若法有猗，是名依緣。復次依緣，若法依法生，此法於彼法依緣。依身有身業、依口有口業、依意有意業。依四大有身、口、意業。依地有稼穡業、種子、聚落、眾生、聚落、藥草、叢林。依惡知識便生惡不善法。依善知識便生善法。依眼依色生眼識及眼識相應法。耳、鼻、舌、身、意亦如是。依內大生內大，依內大生外大，依內大生內外大。依外大生內大，依外大生外大，依外大生內外大。依內外大生內大，依內外大生外大，依內外大生內外大。滅亦如是。是名依緣。</span> <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0679b19" target="_blank">T1548.28.679b19</a>).</p>
<p><em>consequential conditioning</em>. C. <span class="ch">報緣</span>, S. <em>vipāka-pratyaya</em>. A consequential condition in this case is an action that brings the consequence of rebirth; however, this type of conditioning is not necessarily the result of a karmic deed. The definition for consequential conditioning provided in ŚāA reads: “If something has a consequence, this is called a consequential condition” (<span class="ch">若法有報，是名報緣。</span> <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0679c3" target="_blank">T1548.28.679c3</a>).</p>
<p><em>productive conditioning</em>. C. <span class="ch">起緣</span>, S. <em>upaniśraya</em>?. The S. equivalent for this term is unclear to me, but the definition is similar to that listed for P. <em>upanissaya-paccaya</em> in the <cite>Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma</cite>. These are conditions combine together in producing something.</p>
<p>The definition for productive conditions provided in ŚāA reads: “If something can produce or be produced, this is called productive conditioning. Furthermore, productive conditioning is if something can produce itself or produce something else by flowing, watering, and growing it. For example, killing by itself has the bonds, skillful and unskillful roots, mental awareness, conceptions, intentions, feelings, and the four elements that are called its productive conditions.” (<span class="ch">若法能起所起，是名起緣。復次起緣，若法自起，能起他流津增長。謂專殺結、善根、不善根、意識、想、思、覺、四大，是名起緣。</span> <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0679c4" target="_blank">T1548.28.679c4</a>).</p>
<p><em>other conditioning</em>. C. <span class="ch">異緣</span>, P. <em>para-pratyaya</em>?. The C. translation of this type of conditioning doesn’t match S. <em>sahajāta</em> (“co-arising”), but the definition given for it is very similar. I’ve opted to translate it literally as perhaps S. <em>para-pratyaya</em>. The definition reads: “If something is concomittant, it’s called other conditioning.” (<span class="ch">何謂異緣？若法共有，是名異緣。</span> <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0679c7" target="_blank">T1548.28.679c7</a>).</p>
<p><em>developmental conditioning</em>. C. <span class="ch">增上緣</span>, S. <em>adhipati-pratyaya</em>. It’s well established that C. <span class="ch">增上</span> translated S. <em>adhipati</em>, but the meanings do not match (“increasing, developing” ≠ “lord, master”). I’ve translated the C. as “develop” in the sense of increasing the growth or maturity of something, which is supported by the definition below:</p>
<p>“If something is greater, this is called a developmental condition. Furthermore, a developmental conditioning is if something is increased by, oriented toward, sheltered by, and inclined toward its arising, whether it’s developed by desire, effort, mind, contemplation, greed, hate, delusion, lack of greed, lack of hate, and lack of delusion, precepts, <em>samādhi</em>, wisdom, self, the world, the Dharma, the eye faculty, or the ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind faculty.” (<span class="ch">何謂增上緣？若法勝，是名增上緣。復次增上緣，若法所增上、所向、所歸、所傾向而生。若以欲增上、以精進增上、以心增上、以思惟增上、以貪增上、以瞋恚增上、以愚癡增上、以無貪增上、以無恚增上、以無癡增上、以戒增上、以定增上、以慧增上、以我增上、以世間增上、以法增上、以眼根增上、以耳鼻舌身意根增上、以增上為增上、以境界增上、以依增上。何謂以欲增上？若法以欲勝而生，彼欲於法為增上緣。</span> <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0679c11" target="_blank">T1548.28.679c11</a>) [<a href="#ref19">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n20"><p>A parallel passage for this paragraph occurs later in the <cite>Sariputra Abhidharma</cite>. It reads: <span class="ch"> 最後識滅已初識即生，無有中間。如影移日續、日移影續，影與日無有中間。如是最後識滅，初識續餘道生。</span> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0679c11" target="_blank">T1548.28.679c11</a>).

<li id="n21"><p>A parallel passage for this paragraph occurs later in the <cite>Śāriputra Abhidharma</cite>. It reads: <span class="ch"> 後識滅已，即生初識，無有中間。如此最後識、若最後識相應法，不至初識。若初識、初識相應法，不至後識。如眼識滅已生耳識，耳識滅已生眼識。眼識相應法不至耳識，耳識相應法不至眼識。如是後識後識相應法不至初識。初識初識相應法不至後識。</span> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0628c9" target="_blank">T1548.28.628c9</a>).</p>
<p>Comparing this to our present passage, it becomes clear that this one has become garbled, confusing the first and last awareness. I’ve corrected the translation accordingly. [<a href="#ref21">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n22"><p>A parallel passage for this paragraph occurs later in the <cite>Śāriputra Abhidharma</cite>. It reads: <span class="ch">若後識滅已即生初識，謂此時過、謂此滅後生、謂此終彼始。非命是身、非身是命、非命異身、非身異命、非命非斷、非生非住、非有變、非無因、非天所作、非此作此受、非異作異受，知有去來、知有生死、知有業相續，知有說法、知有緣，無有從此至彼者、無有從彼至此者，但行相續生，以業緣故。</span> (<a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0628c9" target="_blank">T1548.28.628c9</a>).

<li id="n23"><p><em>live in</em>. C. <span class="ch">堪忍住</span>. This expression would usu. for understood to mean “patiently” or “enduringly abide.” In fact, while it does typically translate words like S. <em>kṣānti</em>, <span class="ch">堪忍</span> could also sometimes translate words like S. <em>adhivāsana</em>, which meant “inhabitant.” This reading makes better sense to me, so I’ve translated the whole expression more functionally as “to live in.” Basically, I take to refer to the practitioner being engrossed in the feelings of happiness and remaining there for an extended time.

<li id="n24"><p><em>the future senses</em>. C. <span class="ch">未來六入</span>. Here, there is an alternate reading that deletes the “six” (<span class="ch">六</span>), and going forward these passages about the form realm read “senses” instead of  “six senses.” This makes sense given there are only four senses listed for the form realm, where it was held that the sense of smell and taste don’t exist. [<a href="#ref24">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n25"><p><em>the body faculty</em>. C. <span class="ch">身根</span>. There is an alternate reading that has the same set of sense faculties as the other form realm heavens (eye, ear, body, and mind), but I have kept to the present Taisho reading of only a body faculty in this heaven, which seems to have been a peculiar heaven added to the form realm to account for a form of <em>samādhi</em> in which all mental activity ceases. [<a href="#ref25">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n26"><p>I’ve adopted a variant reading that deletes the duplication of this paragraph. It would seem that a copyist lost his place and repeated this paragraph in abbreviated form. [<a href="#ref26">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n27"><p><em>grasping of desires</em>. C. <span class="ch">欲界取</span>. The conclusion to this question reads “grasping of desires” (<span class="ch">欲取</span>), and the questions that follow offer definitions for the same set of graspings as the previous paragraph. I therefore assume that the insertion of <span class="ch">界</span> is a mistake which changed the question to “What is the grasping of the desire realm?” [<a href="#ref27">back</a>]</p></li>
<li id="n28"><p>Old age is described in three other passages in the <cite>Śāriputra Abhidharma</cite>: At <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0552c23" target="_blank">T1548.28.552c23</a>, <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0605b20" target="_blank">605b20</a>, and <a href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/zh/T28n1548_p0688a12" target="_blank">688a12</a>. Each of these passages has some variations, which are probably due both to different word choices by the translator and varying levels of detail in the original text. Alternative definitions of the other facets of suffering defined below are also found in the third passage beginning at 688a12. [<a href="#ref28">back</a>]</p></li>
